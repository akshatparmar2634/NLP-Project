0,"Hi Italy! Just opening up communication, and I want to know what some of your initial thoughts on the game are and if/how we can work together",True,1,0,germany,italy,0,87
0,"Well....that's a great question, and a lot of it comes down to how free I'll be left to play in the West, no?",True,1,0,italy,germany,1,132
0,"Well, if you want to attack France in the Mediterranean while I attack through Burgundy you can have Marseille and Iberia while I take Brest and Paris, then with France out of the way you could focus on Turkey or Austria. Sound fair?",False,1,0,germany,italy,2,138
0,"Hello, I'm just asking about your move to Tyrolia. It's making me more than a little concerned",True,1,1,germany,italy,3,207
0,Totally understandable - but did you notice the attempt at Trieste?  Tyrolia is the natural support position for that attempt 🙂,False,1,-1,italy,germany,4,221
1,Hey Italy! What's your plan for the game?,True,1,0,austria,italy,0,81
1,"Bongiorno!  To crush my enemies, see them driven before me, and hear the lamentations of their women!  I mean, umm, not really sure yet.  Pondering whether or not to make an early play around Munich",True,1,0,italy,austria,1,128
1,"I'd personally rather you didn't, because a play around Munich is also a play around Trieste and Vienna. I've heard that there's some rancor over in the West and you might be able to profit from a mobbed France if you went that way.",True,0,0,austria,italy,2,134
1,"Good to know, thanks!",True,1,0,italy,austria,3,135
1,"Well, that went well! Shall we push on with the ways we started?",True,1,0,austria,italy,4,162
1,So...was that a no?,True,1,-1,italy,austria,6,306
1,Indeed.,True,1,1,austria,italy,7,308
1,Peccato.  I was really hoping we could bring order (or at least mutual profit) out of the chaos.,True,1,-1,italy,austria,8,309
1,Sorry we couldn't patch things up.,True,1,-1,italy,austria,9,527
2,Hey Italy! How’s it going?!,True,1,1,russia,italy,0,35
2,Hahha what’s good?,True,1,-1,russia,italy,2,254
2,Hahahah that’s the spirit sir!,True,1,-1,russia,italy,4,313
2,Hey Italy - what’s good?,True,1,1,russia,italy,5,478

3,"Just to be clear, that was all in a pasta life.",True,1,0,italy,england,1,127
3,From this one interaction alone I trust you. Please dont betray me and make me eat dish of regretti and meatballs.,True,1,0,england,italy,2,133
4,"We both hate how I vs T just slows us both down, right?  Why do we have to be the slow powers in this game?  I say: we don't!  Let's be unconventional.  I have done fun I/T alliances before, but it all depends on making it work.  Let me know if you have any thoughts, or want to just see how the first few seasons roll out, or if there are things you'd like to see from me.",True,1,0,turkey,italy,0,31
4,"I mean, if I'm free to go another direction, I'll take it in a heartbeat - and I doubt you'll be very upset at my opening moves 🙂",True,1,0,italy,turkey,1,129
4,His dots are closer to you. 😃,True,1,-1,italy,turkey,2,412
4,hahahahaha really?,True,1,1,turkey,italy,3,421
4,"If Austria retreats to one of your centers, I guess it means they don't care about trying to repair anything with you, and Just Loves Them Dots, yeah?",True,1,1,turkey,italy,4,434
4,"I may be able to hit Tri in the fall, which would cut it's ability to support Ven, by the way.  If Ion retreats to Adr, that may not help you, but if it retreats to Tun or Nap it would, I guess?  Let's see how the retreats go.",True,1,1,turkey,italy,5,435
4,"So, now his dots are a LOT closer to you than mine are. 😃  I'm guessing you're ordering into Trieste anyway to protect Serbia while you take Greece with Bulgaria and Aegean. So the question is what is ion doing?",True,1,-1,italy,turkey,6,486
4,"It's at your disposal if you want support into Tunis, if that's what you're getting at.",True,1,1,turkey,italy,7,487
4,"Oh, come now. It's much more amusing to support you into Tunis. That advances the positions rather than retards them",True,1,-1,italy,turkey,8,488
4,"Bwa! are you serious?  I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I feel like I'm greedy enough stabbing Austria for 3!",True,1,1,turkey,italy,9,489
4,"Any other arrangement opens me for a stab and sets us up for conflict. Tunis is better for you than Naples, and it's a lot better for me to have you there with a path forward than tied up with me. If you feel bad about it, support me to Trieste",True,1,-1,italy,turkey,10,490
4,"Ok, that's totally sensible logic.  I may end up having to pass up on Greece and catch it next year.  I can support you into Trieste, if you'd rather have that than retaking Venice, sure.",True,1,1,turkey,italy,11,491
4,"Oh nevermind, you can get both, nice!",True,1,1,turkey,italy,12,492
4,"unless Gre taps Ser, in which case you still recapture Ven, and Austria is stranded in Tri.",True,1,1,turkey,italy,13,493
4,"Correct. Which is what I'm expecting, but I can hope for Trieste. 😀",True,1,-1,italy,turkey,14,494
4,You heartless bastard - I can't believe you took him from 5 to 0.,True,1,-1,italy,turkey,15,526
4,"It was kinder this way. Put ‘em out of their misery, y’know?",True,1,1,turkey,italy,16,528
4,Lol. Probably. That is the great thing about Austria -you either do well or you get to go play another game.,True,1,-1,italy,turkey,17,529
4,"Yep. I’m finishing up game 10 of this series now as Austria. Currently on 14 centers, but England has Tunis so no win for me 😦",True,1,1,turkey,italy,18,530
4,"Ah, well.   So, what's the plan from here?  How far are you planning on riding that juggernaut?",True,1,-5,italy,turkey,19,535
4,"Well I want to see Russia moves hard on Germany. If they do, well I have a history of jumping on big openings, y’know? :). Otherwise fleets are heading toward Gibraltar!",True,1,5,turkey,italy,20,541
4,Sounds fun!,True,1,-5,italy,turkey,21,553
4,"Also, weirdly, my phone doesn't seem to be updating me with latest messages the way it should, so I end up seeing these a lot later than I should",True,1,-5,italy,turkey,22,554
4,"So I tried to move towards a more forward position so I could fight France an d stab Russia, and *not* fight you, but you’re kinda putting yourself directly in my way, y’know?",True,1,5,turkey,italy,23,575
4,I could’ve kept you out of Ion permanently but that wasn’t what I thought was very interesting long term. :/,True,1,5,turkey,italy,24,576
4,"Yeah, I wasn't seeing any response from you, so I moved to defend.  We're having some communication issues based on mis-timing, I think.  Cost us most of a turn, but we have the weekend to work out a way forward, nu?",False,1,-5,italy,turkey,25,590
4,"Sure, understood.  How about this to fix it: Tys S Tun-Wes, Ion-Tun?  You take back a dot, but we push the position forwards toward Iberia?",True,0,5,turkey,italy,26,595
4,are you still not getting any messages from me?,True,1,5,turkey,italy,27,601
4,That could definitely work - and it does advance the positions,True,1,-5,italy,turkey,28,602
4,"Otherwise this game is going to be a long, unpleasant slog",True,1,-5,italy,turkey,29,603
4,I get your messages fine on the computer - it's the phone that seems to not update properly for some reason.  I just hadn't checked the computer yesterday as I should have 🙂,True,1,-5,italy,turkey,30,604
4,"Ok, France has told me outright they're wanting to make sure that ""Italy is divided fairly"", so I doubt they'll expect me pushing past you toward the west.",True,1,5,turkey,italy,31,616
4,"Looks that way, yes",True,1,-5,italy,turkey,32,633
4,"It's too bad we can't find a way to work together to force me out into MAO, instead of whittling down your defenses season by season.  Once you lose a center, this is going to crumble really quickly, but I'd totally be willing to try something else, even though we both didn't do what we said we do last season.",True,1,4,turkey,italy,33,697
4,"Aye, it's not a *great* plan to just turtle up and try to outlast the juggernaut.  Would love to see or be shown a better option.",True,1,-4,italy,turkey,34,700
4,"Yeah.  For this season, there’s no point in trying to negotiate something: the risk is too high for you on a fall turn.  But maybe once you’re turtled up and we’re looking at a slightly safer spring move, we can discuss some way to slingshot me past you",True,0,4,turkey,italy,35,701
4,Absolutely.,True,1,-4,italy,turkey,36,709
4,And sorry for slow reply - been traveling,True,1,-4,italy,turkey,37,710
4,tap-tap,True,1,-4,italy,turkey,39,712
4,Whassup?,True,1,4,turkey,italy,40,714
4,Making sure the mic was working now,True,1,-4,italy,turkey,41,723
4,Heh indeed it is!,True,1,4,turkey,italy,42,724
5,"Hi Italy, hope you're doing well. I'll be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys  dmz'd if that's ok with you?",True,1,0,france,italy,0,101
5,Hope you are around. Would be good to chat at least briefly 🙂,True,1,0,france,italy,1,126
5,"Had some technical issues, but the trains are running on time now.",True,1,0,italy,france,2,130
5,"Great, what do you think of my proposal?",True,1,0,france,italy,3,136
5,"Shoot, I was running through the messages so fast I forgot about your proposal by the time I responded.  Sounds like you might have enough on your hands without me annoying you in sensitive spaces, so I'm happy to honor such a DMZ",True,1,0,italy,france,4,137
5,"Thanks, let's have a good game!",True,1,0,france,italy,5,139
5,"Oh, gdi.  Now I have to tell a truth that sounds like the most cliched lie in the game: my order update didn't take, I wasn't intending to go to Piedmont.  Yes, I know it sounds ridiculous, but in this case true.",False,1,0,italy,france,6,140
5,"Good news is that with your opinion this is more of an opportunity than a disaster (I'd still rather be in Tyrolia where I'm *supposed* to be) - I can bounce you in Mars to help keep you in Burgundy, or if you tell me to eff off, I can move back up to Tyrolia",False,1,0,italy,france,7,141
5,"Yes, please, go off on adventures elsewhere ...",True,1,0,france,italy,8,142
5,Will do!,False,1,0,italy,france,9,155
5,What plans do you have for Boh? I can maybe support you into Mun if that is likely to succeed,True,1,0,france,italy,10,303
5,"As awesome as that sounds, I have an Austrian problem to deal with first.  Hopefully diplomatically, we'll see",True,1,0,italy,france,11,304
5,"Do you need help? I could build a fleet in Mar, maybe",True,1,1,france,italy,12,404
5,"You probably have other priorities to attend to, but if can get in position I'm happy to do anything that frustrates Austria",True,1,-1,italy,france,13,411
5,"If you can help a push into Munich, then that's one less flank for you to worry about",True,1,1,france,italy,14,431
5,"How are you holding up? It looks bad initially, but Austria will need to disband a lot in Fall because of Turkey's stab. Not sure how you will come out of it though. Do you need help in fending off Turkey?",True,1,1,france,italy,15,453
5,"Oh, I'm fine, and highly amused I wouldn't mind being the mover into Munich, though.",False,1,-1,italy,france,16,484
5,I don't think I'm going for munich this turn but you can give it a shot,True,1,1,france,italy,17,485
5,Just as well I didn't see this before the turn processed.,True,1,-1,italy,france,18,531
5,I was thinking the same thing...,True,1,1,france,italy,19,532
5,"Austria dead in one turn, impressive",True,1,1,france,italy,20,533
5,Poor guy - I was really upset we couldn't come to any sort of agreement or arrangement.,False,1,-2,italy,france,21,534
5,"So, now that Turkey is going to have 4 fleets in the Mediterranean, what's in the future?",True,1,2,france,italy,22,549
5,I doubt they're just going to sit there and let us be.,True,1,2,france,italy,23,550
5,"War, my friend.  War is in our future.  The faster you can get your fleets into play, the better it will go for us",True,1,-2,italy,france,24,552
5,Ok. I'll try to get there.,True,1,2,france,italy,25,593
5,I'm also moving Mar to Pie. Hope that's ok with you.,True,1,2,france,italy,26,594
5,It is what it is.  We needs do what we must,True,1,-2,italy,france,27,605
5,"I'm sure you expect that I'm coming to attack you and, indeed, Turkey is trying to set me up against you. But the way I look at it is that if we were to split your CP, Turkey would still win. I can't let that happen",True,1,2,france,italy,28,610
5,Now you can retreat to Tun and get a CP,True,1,2,france,italy,29,634
5,"What, pray tell, does CP stand for?",True,1,-2,italy,france,30,642
5,"Oh, sorry it's a supply center. I think mixed lingo there",True,1,2,france,italy,31,643
5,"I figured you meant support center, I was just curious which language had the abbreviation as CP. 😃",True,1,-2,italy,france,32,656
5,Probably some strategy game,True,1,2,france,italy,33,684
5,I'm hoping to get to Mun this round. if you could support Ruh into Mun that would be appreciated. I can support Tyr in turn,True,1,2,france,italy,34,685
5,"Alternatively, pressure R somehow to take away support from Mun.",True,1,2,france,italy,35,686
5,We should also come up with a strategy for the mediterranean,True,1,2,france,italy,36,690
5,"I figure T is going to Very annoying with that fleet, threatening my supply or supporting a push into Italy. Not quite sure yet how to resolve that.",True,1,2,france,italy,37,691
6,"Hello Austria! I just want to open up communications, since the two of us will be working together for most of the game.",True,1,0,germany,austria,0,84
6,Indeed! What's your read on the west thus far?,True,1,0,austria,germany,1,89
6,"I haven't heard back from anyone else yet, so I'm assuming it's going to develop the normal way (me and France fighting in the west while you and Russia fight in the east). It's critical for us to work together so we aren't steamrolled by either France-England or Russia-Turkey, so do you want to agree to an alliance right off the bat?",True,1,0,germany,austria,2,90
6,"Absolutely. One of my favorite things about this game is that it can reflect real life history in certain grander strategic considerations, one of which is that, just as would have been the case, neither Germany nor Austria benefits from an antagonistic relationship.",True,1,0,austria,germany,3,91
6,"So given the first move, I think the two of us are in a relatively strong position. Turkey seems to be focusing more on Russia than you, and England and France are fighting. Are you going to focus more on Russia or Turkey first? I could try and stop Russia from taking Scandinavia unopposed, but I'd need assurance first that you're going to put pressure on them from the south since a move like Warsaw --> Silesia would screw both of us.",True,1,0,germany,austria,4,159
6,"I'm feeling pretty solid about working with Turkey, so Russia is the target for now.",True,1,0,austria,germany,5,160
6,So it seems like Italy's turned on us. I can support Vienna --> Tyrolia next move if you want,True,1,0,germany,austria,6,208
6,"I'm down. Turkey and I will be able to crack Ionian, and Italy will fall hard.",True,1,0,austria,germany,7,209
7,Hey Germany! How’s it going? Looking forward to a fun game!,True,1,1,russia,germany,0,53
7,"Hello! I'm looking forward to a fun game as well. I usually see good things happen when Russia and Germany work together, so I hope we can both help each other in our initial plans. I'm assuming you're gonna try and attack Scandinavia first? Let me know your thoughts, and I look forward to us working well together",True,0,-1,germany,russia,1,85
7,Hi Germany - sorry I’m behind the eightball here - got swamped with work,True,1,-2,russia,germany,2,256
7,But that seems to have worked out well for you so I’m sure you’re not too upset lol,True,1,-2,russia,germany,3,257
7,Haha word,True,1,-2,russia,germany,5,316
8,How's it going Germany just wanted to reach out and get your thoughts on the game?,True,1,0,england,germany,0,71
8,"Hello. I don't have much to go off yet since no orders have been placed, but I'm hoping we can work together during this game. At least in my experience, Germany and Britain tend to work well together since we both have the threat of France, and I would be willing to fend them off while you attack the Russians up north. Let me know your thoughts",True,1,0,germany,england,1,83
8,I like to work with people so I'm open to that plan. I figured I would probably stalemate with Russia for a while while they figured out what was happening down south.,True,1,0,england,germany,2,95
8,It feels like years since we've talked. I've noticed russia hasn't really made any moves into the north and wanted to know if we could amicably split up the northern territories?,True,1,-1,england,germany,3,230
8,"I agree, it seems like Russia is undefended in St. Petersburg. If you let me keep Sweden you can have whatever other centres you want in Russia.",False,1,1,germany,england,4,290
9,Hello Turkey! Just opening up communication,True,1,0,germany,turkey,0,88
9,Comms channel authenticated. Ready to receive transmissions!,True,1,0,turkey,germany,1,92
9,"Wait, so why are you attacking both France and England at the same time?  That seems... dangerous?",True,1,0,turkey,germany,2,355
9,"I wasn't attacking them, I had non-aggression with them and I had assumed they would've been preoccupied with Russia at least for a few years. I think I can kick out their army in Holland, and from there I guess we'll see what happens.",True,1,0,germany,turkey,3,356
9,"""non-aggression"" doesn't exist in this game, in my experience.  You either have allies who you work with to divide spoils, or you have people fighting you or about to.",True,1,0,turkey,germany,4,358
9,"Moving Kie-Hel is a clear act of aggression against England.  Which is fine since they attacked you at the same time, but if they hadn't, they certainly would now!",True,1,0,turkey,germany,5,359
9,"I agree, I was mostly relying on the fact that England wouldn't attack France, Russia, AND me at the same time.",True,1,0,germany,turkey,6,360
9,We'll see how things play out,True,1,0,germany,turkey,7,361
9,"England didn't - they *helped* Russia, and given they didn't move to ECH last season, they've clearly been resolving their issues with France.  I would assume they are talking a lot at this point.",True,1,0,turkey,germany,8,362
9,"They're taken ECH now, and even if the support into Sweden proves Russia and England have an alliance there isn't much they can do. I agree that I'm in a bit of a tight spot, but I still have full confidence, especially with you and Austria taking on Russia and Italy so effectively.",True,1,0,germany,turkey,9,364

9,Shit...,True,1,0,germany,turkey,11,366
9,"What you need is an ally you can count on, or you'll be going down quickly unless the board changes significantly.  Maybe start talking to France?",True,1,0,turkey,germany,12,367
9,already have been,True,1,0,germany,turkey,13,368
9,"Heh, talking while punching hard into Bur makes it hard to come up with a good alliance plan...",True,1,0,turkey,germany,14,369

10,"Hi Germany, good to talk to you. Were you hoping for particular command centers in the low lands? I'm considering going for belgium",True,1,0,france,germany,1,99
10,"Based on what I've heard so far (I have a suspicion England might try for either Holland or Belgium). I'm gonna go for a pretty conservative start (Kiel --> Denmark, Berlin --> Kiel, Munich Hold). Do you want to agree that I take Holland and you take Belgium, then see where we go from there?",True,0,0,germany,france,2,103
10,I think that's fine with me.,False,1,0,france,germany,3,109

10,"Ok, let's see how things play out and I'll be in touch if I need help",True,1,0,france,germany,6,115
10,It's unfortunate you decided to move this way because now it gets more difficult to stop England,True,1,0,france,germany,7,143
10,"I agree, there's a good chance England can take Belgium this fall, but I'm also still confident in my position. I'm sorry about your position, that's mostly bad luck.",True,1,0,germany,france,8,156
10,You had assured me Munich would hold but then I find out it moves to Bur instead.,True,1,0,france,germany,9,157
10,It wouldn't have changed the final position anyway since you supported with Marseille.,True,1,0,germany,france,10,158
10,I would've liked to work together and at least take out england quickly,False,0,-1,france,germany,11,288
10,But I see you have other plans,True,1,-1,france,germany,12,289
10,"So, given the moves of England this Fall, it seems clear that they're attacking both of us. I know I've been... aggressive to you in the past, and I know that chances are you won't believe me or agree to work with me, but if you hear me out we both can gain from this (and utterly destroy England in the process). I'll retreat from Burgundy this Spring, and I'll agree to not invade any more territories of yours until all of England is destroyed. I'm assuming you're going to build a fleet in Brest, and if you do so and move Bre --> Eng in the spring it would cut any support that fleet could provide and I can kick England out of the North Sea. From there I can help support you in to the English Channel or we could work to convoy an army into the British Isles in the next few years. I hope you consider.",True,1,0,germany,france,13,372

11,"Well, I suppose it's probably a mite hypocritical of me to get angry about the Galicia bounce, but, since you didn't confirm a DMZ, I felt like I had to protect it. Now that we've seen some tangible move data, what are you thinking?",True,1,-1,austria,russia,2,161
11,I’m down to work together! I got swamped at work yesterday (I work in politics lol) and this slipped my mind. Won’t happen again,True,1,-2,russia,austria,3,253

13,Solid plan. I'm in.,True,1,0,austria,turkey,1,15
13,"Cool.  Let's see how our neighbors start talking to see how easiest to proceed (i.e if I need to gun right after Russia out of the gate [and hence watching my back against an early agressive Italy], or if I can slip fleets out into the med super early, because we think Russia might not be as much of an early concern, etc...)",True,0,0,turkey,austria,2,23

29,Alright. We'll leave it for now. I was hoping to get you into brest as soon as possible and then me into Paris and then decide from there? Likely you in Iberia and me in Marseilles but I don't want to count our chickens before they're hatched,True,0,0,germany,england,8,22
29,Alright sounds good.,True,1,0,england,germany,9,29
29,Hey what's the deal with France? They're talking about an alliance between us three to counter Russia and Italy?,False,0,0,england,germany,10,108
29,He hasn't told me about that. An EFGs an interesting proposition... But idk. What do you think? And wdu mean what's his deal?,True,0,0,germany,england,11,116
29,But he may just have figured we want to move west and tried to throw me off,True,1,0,england,germany,13,121
29,I ask because he said he already talked to you about it.,True,0,0,england,germany,14,122
29,"I think I'm going to go EC to be aggressive on France, and take Norway",True,0,0,england,germany,15,123
29,He also said he's working closely w france,True,1,0,germany,england,16,124
29,Let's be aggressive with france so we can switch back to Russia asap,True,1,0,germany,england,17,125
29,Hm yeah Russia also told me there were murmurs you wanted to attack me,True,1,0,germany,england,18,126
29,My only dialogue with Russia has been to advocate for the equal sharing of Scandinavia. I've been told that Russia seems to want to commit south.,True,1,0,england,germany,19,128
29,"I suspect that France and Russia are both worried about two players moving on them early, and may be in an alliance to stretch us out.",True,1,0,england,germany,20,129
29,"If Russia DOES want to commit south, it is logical that they'd try to prevent a united northern threat. Considering that Rus/Fr may be coordinating, I am going to play cautiously  and refrain from committing east or west",True,1,0,england,germany,21,131
29,Russia admitted to me that he's in an alliance with france,True,1,0,germany,england,22,138
29,"He intends to move on you it seems, so I don't think he's truly committing south. Maybe just maintaining a hold. Either way time will tell",True,1,0,germany,england,23,139
29,You told me you were looking to move aggressively against France. If we can get Russia distracted by turkey especially with Austrian help ik the south their alliance won't matter,True,1,0,germany,england,24,140
29,I was gonna play aggressive but i'm going to slow down to protect my expansion. I don't want to deprive myself of builds because I spread myself too thin,True,1,0,england,germany,25,145
29,"I'm gonna to move to secure Norway, and maybe place myself to support you in Benelux or move against France next turn",True,1,0,england,germany,26,146
29,If Fr's fleet moves to secure Spain I'll go in,True,1,0,england,germany,27,147
29,Alright. Sounds fine with me. Just let me know of your intentions going forward so I don't end up acting alone. Seems like Russia is focused on the south which is excellent news for a move on France if we could just get Austria involved. He's playing awfully passive,True,1,0,germany,england,28,161
29,"Regarding France, are you trying to take Belgium? I would prefer to have it because otherwise you can get 3 builds and myself only 1",True,1,0,england,germany,30,177
29,it works on the website I normally play,True,1,0,england,germany,31,178
29,I'm not sure. I was under the impression I could move an army into a space that was becoming vacant,True,1,0,england,germany,32,179
29,oh I realize now that I'm a fool and it doesnt border. I wasnt paying attention putting down the move,True,1,0,england,germany,33,180
29,Lol yeah they don't border 😂,True,1,0,germany,england,34,229
29,"And I hate to be so greedy to open up but I'm nervous that if I forego a build it opens me up to have Russia, France or both collapse on me and then we're really fucked. Particularly if France walks into Munich, I'll need both builds badly",True,0,0,germany,england,35,232
29,I'm more than willing to cede territory to you going forward when I'm better in a position to subdue France or Russia depending on what we've decided. Does that sound alright?,True,0,0,germany,england,36,233
29,It's really funny that you mention France and Munich.,True,1,0,england,germany,37,236
29,"It just so happens that I've been talking to France, and they're under the impression that I'll bounce you out of Denmark if they march into Munich.",True,1,0,england,germany,38,237
29,Ah so he is moving into Munich? While I'd rather have that scenario not happen,True,1,0,germany,england,39,239
29,"He may very well test my loyalty and let me try to bounce out of Denmark first, but he offered to march to Munich if I bounced you",True,1,0,england,germany,40,240
29,Btw have you talked to Italy?,True,0,0,england,germany,41,241
29,(my last message doesn't look to have sent correctly so I'll repeat),True,1,0,england,germany,42,242
29,Have you talked to Italy? They might be helpful soon,True,1,0,england,germany,43,243
29,Anywho I'm gonna try to tie up the French fleet and take Norway. We can talk about territory later,False,1,0,england,germany,44,245
29,Well how would you like to work this one out?,True,1,0,germany,england,45,246
29,And he hadn't responded in a while. Just messaged him again,True,1,0,germany,england,46,247
29,Alright so how are you looking to move and are you fine letting me have the three builds?,True,1,0,germany,england,47,249
29,"I'm going Nor and EC. You can have your  3 builds rn, but I'll be expecting land later since you're getting two builds on me",True,1,0,england,germany,48,250
29,"Also if France asks you about an alliance, we definitely had a convo about a loose 3 way alliance",True,1,0,england,germany,49,254
29,Alright excellent. Sounds good. We'll even it out. Promise that. I just want a healthy border around my home centers and a guarantee I can push back France,True,0,0,germany,england,50,258
29,Oh OK. So you and I had a convo about a loose efg?,True,1,0,germany,england,51,259
29,Yeah. Just in case France tries to check,True,1,0,england,germany,52,264
29,Right makes sense,True,1,1,germany,england,53,270
29,But he attacked me so I'm moving in,True,1,1,germany,england,54,271
29,Alright that sounds good. Do you want me to move into Brest?,True,0,-1,england,germany,55,290
29,Also what should I go about building?,True,1,-1,england,germany,56,335
29,Go for it although hell probably build a fleet there,True,1,1,germany,england,57,338
29,Oh sorry missed this,True,1,1,germany,england,58,399
29,You built a fleet in Edinburgh? Why? I'd think you'd want it in London no?,True,1,1,germany,england,59,400
29,"Yeah I was thinking London for a long time but I reached the conclusion that i would feel better with a fleet that could serve as a sort of home fleet, and I figured London served as a better base for attacks",True,1,-1,england,germany,60,401
29,"I'm not sure yet if its a good plan, but I figured no harming in trying it out",True,1,-1,england,germany,61,402
29,Alright can we renegotiate? I'm not sure what France said to sway you. Was it the three initial builds? Cuz you can have Belgium. I'd just really prefer to knock out France. Belgium brest and Portugal can be yours. All I want is Paris and Italy can take Marseilles and Spain. Really we can really negotiate however I'd just rather not be at odds w you. Now I'd figure you'd much rather ally w me seeing as France has struck a deal w every nation I've talked to so far which makes him not that trustworthy and he has three fleets that can easily slip in your back door to my one that you have pinned on land... So if you head my way he's gonna walk in your back door. I would bet you money. What do you say? Can we strike some sort of deal?,True,1,1,germany,england,63,423
29,Le me know your thoughts,True,1,1,germany,england,64,446
29,"I'm sorry mate. France's fleets are too big for me to piss him off. I won't push past Denmark, and if you can negotiate peace with him I'll respect it",True,1,-1,england,germany,65,453
29,Alright. Understood,True,0,1,germany,england,66,454
29,I mean honestly mate he's gonna attack you either way. And the two of us can stop him... I'm not sure why you'd back off like that. I don't mean to be rude but how much experience do you have with this game?,True,1,1,germany,england,67,455
29,I'm saying honestly both cuz it's by far the most logical thing to do and he's in great position to do it now that he's advanced and you've completely backed off and cuz it's literally what he told me he was going to do,True,1,1,germany,england,68,456
29,What makes you say we can push him back if he has deals with everyone?,True,1,-1,england,germany,69,463
29,"If you surrender Denmark to me, I will help you survive France's push. I am not going to involve myself in this war for either side without immediately tangible benefits. France is a difficult invasion for me, and I've spent a lot of time in the North Sea with no new land.",True,0,-1,england,germany,70,469
29,He doesn't have actual deals. Not ones people are intending to follow through on cuz they don't trust him cuz he makes deals w everyone. Russia doesn't trust him and is way too busy w Austria and turkey. Italy doesn't trust him either and I convinced him to invade the south although he's kind of a mess at the moment. I actually don't know if turkey or Austria has any sort of deal with france. And who is actually free to intervene against us?,True,1,1,germany,england,71,485
29,"I'm not sure how you can make tangible benefits if you don't involve yourself though honestly. And if you help me out we'll topple France and how can I come attack you? Honestly. France is headed for you as we speak and is trying to sue for peace with me so that he can complete his invasion of you. Not to mention he has three fleets you just turned your back on. Please, listen to reason here. Either way, I'd much rather you take Belgium. Can we make that deal?",True,1,1,germany,england,72,486
29,Sorry about the delay. I'm willing to exchange Belgium for cooperation against France.,True,0,-1,england,germany,73,497
29,Alright sounds good,True,0,1,germany,england,74,499
29,How should I move? I don't know how to handle his fleets,True,1,-1,england,germany,75,502
29,But we can fix this,NOANNOTATION,0,1,germany,england,77,525
29,"If you move to the north Atlantic, English Channel and North sea and your army to Wales you can cover your back side and set up a convoy route into France",True,1,1,germany,england,78,526
29,How's that sound,True,1,1,germany,england,79,527
29,"I am not gonna go Nor Atl bcause I want a fleet in Nor, but the rest sounds good. France wants to move into Picardy this turn",True,1,-1,england,germany,80,530
29,"Also given how weird the western triangle has been, can I ask what you're going to do with your fleet? turning to face france leaves me vulnerable in that regard",True,1,-1,england,germany,81,531
29,Oh I honestly don't know yet,True,1,1,germany,england,82,747
29,But I start the game w it and built two armies so I'm not exactly looking for naval dominance,True,1,1,germany,england,83,748

30,Not yet. Have you?,True,1,0,germany,turkey,2,30
30,Nothing yet either.,True,1,0,turkey,germany,3,32
30,Alright keep me updated,True,1,0,germany,turkey,4,41
30,I think Russia is committing south. Do you plan to bounce him out of Sweden?,False,1,0,turkey,germany,5,90
30,What makes you say that? And no not likely,True,1,0,germany,turkey,6,117
30,Well he has told me he wants to attack Austria. And Austria has told me that he told them that he wanted to attack me. If either of those are true then a 3 unit south start seems likely.,True,1,0,turkey,germany,7,127
30,Hm understood. I think either way it might be in your best interests to jump on Russia. I can't right away but I can come help you later in the game,True,0,0,germany,turkey,8,157
30,"Yeah, I guess you have France to worry about? Otherwise Warsaw would be a pretty easy option for you.",False,1,0,turkey,germany,9,520

31,"Sorry for the brief message- I'll be available for more negotiation later today.

31,No worries. Alright. I understand the move to burgundy but I think it should be obvious that any move into my territory would be met with aggression. Update me in the fall of your intentions?,True,1,0,germany,france,2,18
31,"Thanks. Yeah, it's not that I don't trust you to DMZ Burgundy, but I can't think of a reason not to make the move honestly since it completely protects me against both you and Italy and still leaves room for us to work together. In that sense it leaves me some flexibility to decide my intentions in the fall- the truth is that I currently have no intentions and will let my targets pick themselves.",False,1,0,france,germany,3,50
31,What are your plans in terms of your moves?,True,1,0,france,germany,4,114
31,"It looks like we've already got ourselves a rat. I've heard rumors of Britain looking to attack me. Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm sure he's roped you in too. While, on the flipside he keeps trying to convince me to attack you alongside him. I think he wants to pit us against each other and use the opportunity to swoop against either or both of us. I think we should knock him out while we have the opportunity",False,0,0,germany,france,5,115
31,"Yeah, I think you could be right about this. What would this look like? Do you think England will end up taking the Channel?",False,1,0,france,germany,6,135
31,Has he contacted you? And I'm not sure. I don't think he'd be that aggressive right from the start. I can't say I know for sure. What do you want to do?,True,0,0,germany,france,7,141
31,"England did contact me. I might be inclined to take the channel if Russia went to St Petersburg with an army, but at the moment I think it is better to wait and see",True,1,0,france,germany,8,153
31,(wait and see in terms of how to attack England),True,1,0,france,germany,9,154
31,Nice opening moves. Are you going for Belgium? I was planning to head there from Burgundy but it looks like you are in a position to support yourself in anyway.,True,1,0,france,germany,10,159
31,Yeah. Like I said seems England wouldn't be so thoroughly aggressive for a first move. But we should keep an eye out you're right,True,0,0,germany,france,11,165
31,Thank you. Yeah I'd like to take Belgium. I hope there's no issue with that,True,1,0,germany,france,12,166
31,I am concerned over you getting 3 builds and would be a lot more comfortable with that arrangement if you build 2 fleets,True,1,0,france,germany,13,190
31,To be honest I haven't thought about builds. I'll build completely contingent on how everyone around me is postured. If you're not in position and russias not in a position to attack me considering two fleets is a lot more viable,True,0,0,germany,france,14,226
31,Now why would you do that my friend? Bad mistake,True,1,-1,germany,france,15,272

31,One more point. England proposed a plan to bounce you out of Denmark (but I knew he was lying about it),False,0,1,france,germany,18,277
31,"See you could've gotten those two fleet builds with Portugal and Spain. You don't need the army in Paris unless you want to attack me. If you don't build your army in Paris and only build the fleets, we'll be fine. If you build the army in Paris it's going to mean war",False,0,-1,germany,france,19,286
31,"I can do that for sure, though it does mean slowing down potential convoys into England. What does this look like more broadly? Would you be willing to build a fleet in Kiel to take the North Sea? Does this mean you are letting me keep Munich so I can build a fourth fleet next turn?",True,1,1,france,germany,20,293
31,"Also, we can get creative with my unit in Munich by sending it to Tyrolia to attack and/or help Austria",False,1,1,france,germany,21,294
31,"I want to make this work to the point of potentially waiving a build, so I hope we can figure this out. Completely realistically speaking, I think EG struggles to take out F, and EF or FG has a much easier time just considering the distribution of builds. That's really important in a game that ends in 1910",False,1,1,france,germany,22,298

31,No response?,True,1,1,france,germany,25,333
31,I couldn't waive a build without hearing anything back from you,True,1,1,france,germany,26,363

31,So let's work something out. What's the game plan?,False,1,-1,germany,france,32,420
31,Why do you seem so determined to go after me? I have you at a stalemate that only England can break meaning he'll reap the rewards and Italy and England are both poorly defended.

Whereas my 2 fleet builds can be used against England and are in position to do so.",False,1,1,france,germany,35,427
31,Cuz you did what I thought you were gonna do. I don't want you taking Belgium and I need you out of ruhr which is one of the places I thought you'd go and is kinda an aggressive move. Now I'm not super interested in giving up Belgium to be honest but I'm not an unreasonable man. Let's negotiate.,True,1,-1,germany,france,36,431

31,Hold on,False,1,-1,germany,france,49,501
31,I mean. One thought is to have me take Belgium this year and for me to give it to you back next year. That way you can build a fleet and I would be out of Ruhr as well (Ruhr to Belgium). And I'd use Belgium to convoy out,True,1,1,france,germany,50,503

35,Looks like you are in good shape. I'd watch out in case Turkey intends to stab you for 2 (Serbia and Greece),True,1,0,france,austria,41,831
35,So. What are your thoughts on this game right now?,True,1,0,france,austria,42,930
35,I love to see you working with Russia against Turkey. I'm assuming a retreat to Ukraine with the idea of taking Rumania?,True,1,1,france,austria,44,1067
35,"By the way, what is your plan with the Adriatic Sea? Will you be fighting Italy?",True,1,1,france,austria,45,1068
35,That was mainly to stop Turkey getting a foothold there,True,1,-1,austria,france,46,1069
35,It might work in our favor actually if the plan is to dislodge Turkey from the Ionian- we have a total of 4 fleets to his 3.,True,1,1,france,austria,47,1076
35,Looks like: Ukraine-Rumania Moscow S Sevastopol H Budapest S Serbia H Serbia S Ukraine-Rumania Galicia S Ukraine-Rumania  will guarantee you Rumania,True,1,1,france,austria,48,1077
35,What is your relationship with Italy like? I thought you two were fighting by bouncing in the Adriatic so much 😅,True,1,1,france,austria,49,1079

35,This game is going very well for you. You have zero threats and allies all around you. You are highly likely to take Bulgaria and/or Greece this year,True,1,4,france,austria,52,1148
35,"We should talk about borders- if you can move your fleet from the Adriatic to Albania it would help you capture Greece, and I'd have no problems staying out of Tyrolia and Trieste if you are willing to do the same.",True,0,4,france,austria,53,1149
35,Thoughts?,True,1,4,france,austria,54,1152
35,"Not sure why Italy disbanded Ionian, but I figure he may have missed the deadline for builds",True,1,4,france,austria,55,1153
35,We need to move quickly if we still want to get the edge on Turkey,True,1,4,france,austria,56,1154
35,"Also, any thoughts on Russia?",True,1,4,france,austria,57,1162
35,"I'm fine with keeping out of Tyr and Tri to maintain a dmz between us  I'm not 100% sure about Russia at the moment, I feel as though as soon as Turkey is gone he will move against me",False,1,-4,austria,france,58,1166
35,"Sounds good. I agree, I would definitely not leave yourself open to being stabbedd by Russia if possible",True,1,4,france,austria,59,1176

35,Ok- I can trust that since I think taking the Ionian and/or Albania is a priority for you,True,0,4,france,austria,63,1223
35,Damn- I seriously did not intend to take Trieste. I had figured I would want to stay in Venice for the time being with you bordering it with two units and didn't think I would actually end up there,True,0,9,france,austria,64,1242
35,"If there is absolutely anything I can do to help you with my army in Trieste, it's your unit to order",True,0,9,france,austria,65,1243
35,I guess just pull back to Venice?,True,1,-9,austria,france,66,1248
35,"Sure- especially if Italy keeps Piedmont, that might be the move. I am also happy to help support Budapest to hold so that you don't lose it to Russia. Speaking of which, I am assuming you are disbanding the Adriatic Sea? It doesn't seem to be very useful since Turkey will be able to keep it out of the Ionian anyway.",NOANNOTATION,0,9,france,austria,67,1249
35,"If you can support a hold in Budapest, could I take Venice for the time being? I'm getting rather weak as it goes",True,1,-9,austria,france,69,1274
35,I feel like you should have kept Albania instead of Adriatic. Putting the fleet in Venice only moves us backwards,True,1,9,france,austria,70,1291
35,I can't stop you from moving to Venice though I do feel like you are better off putting it on the front lines,True,0,9,france,austria,71,1294
35,"Disbanding Albania was a mistake, I'll admit",True,1,-9,austria,france,72,1298
35,"I was assuming a move like that meant you might be working with Turkey again, which would probably be a huge help for you",True,1,9,france,austria,73,1299
35,"Darn, we weren't on the same page last turn, but I'm super glad to see you work with Turkey again",True,1,9,france,austria,74,1319
35,Russia is in a really good position to wipe you off the map so I would definitely try to slow him down. I'll do what I can in the North,True,1,9,france,austria,75,1320
35,"Just as a sidenote, I noticed you held in Budapest, but it could have potentially supported Serbia to Rumania.",True,1,9,france,austria,76,1321
35,"Sorry, the bot was down for a short bit. If you support Budapest to hold with Serbia and Turkey cuts Rumania, you'll keep Budapest: otherwise you probably will lose it to Russia",True,1,9,france,austria,77,1331
35,"I'm not sure I'm very interested in that because we only just started making progress against Russia, and Russia/Turkey alliance is always scary and may be able to overpower me in the long run (they don't want to give me any of the builds)",NOANNOTATION,0,13,france,austria,81,1423

36,"Hi england! I'm assumimg that you're planning on heading to Nwy, and Germany would go to Denmark. If we could share that would be great! I would preffer if you went there with a fleet instead of a unit. I would be willing to give you unaposed access to Nwy if you agree to this (I won't move Mos-Stp, then Stp-Nor for a stand-off).

36,"I'm a bit confused here. I'm willing to help you take Denmark, but I am going to need something in return. I love the alliance between you me and France, but taking Denmark doesn't really benefit anybody but you. I would be willing to support you into Denmark, if  you move your fleet in the Norwegian west. I really don't like the look of all three of your fleets hovering over Scandinavia.

I appreciate you're cooperation. I fear if we go to war, I will be pressured from all sides and will be eliminated. But, that would probably also end the alliance with you and France, and they are looking in a much better position then you right now. So I would really like to continue our alliance.

38,We should both keep talking to england; maybe suggest some orders that would make our attack more effective,True,1,-2,russia,france,222,1191
38,"True. Just to be safe, it would be a good idea to dislodge the north Sea and prevent any convoys. It's going to mean England will know what's up, but I think our attack is unstoppable anyway. I think I can do this with just Belgium and English Channel",True,1,2,france,russia,223,1192
38,It might be smart to move Norway-Sweden and St Petersburg-Norway in order to try and make a play for Denmark too next year,True,1,2,france,russia,224,1193
38,Oh man I wish I could have seen that in time so we could have coordinated...,True,1,-2,russia,france,225,1207
38,Oh well,True,1,-2,russia,france,226,1208
38,No worries,True,1,2,france,russia,227,1214
38,"I am supporting Berlin to Kiel so absolutely make sure Sevastopol is open for a fleet build (probably Moscow-Sevastopol and Ukraine-Sevastopol). Also try not to let Turkey find out, because otherwise he might try to support you into Sev",True,1,2,france,russia,228,1215
38,Any thoughts on what you want to do with Norway?,True,1,2,france,russia,229,1216
38,"Ok sounds good. Nwy will move to Ska maybe to take denmark, since you are already big and it wouldn't really make sense for you to have it after this turn(so take it this turn and I'll take it back and support u somewhere else instead) if thats ok with yo",True,1,-2,russia,france,230,1224
38,"Sounds good regarding moving to Skag. We can definitely organize a way to split up English supply centers, though I am a bit cautious of doing it now since I expect to be losing supply centers in the short term (to Austria).",True,1,2,france,russia,231,1229
38,So you moved to the North Sea. What gives?,True,1,3,france,russia,232,1231
38,"Yeah last minute I decided that was a better position, since one of us should probalby occupy it, and it also has access to denmark. I hope that's ok and doesn't come accross as agressive. I will totally move out of there next turn if u ask me too, since you have more fleets that need to get out into the sea",True,1,-3,russia,france,233,1236
38,"But I think that turn went amazing; I got rum from austria, and bounced in sev. Looks like you did pretty well too. I think if we continue this alliance, we could totally win",True,1,-3,russia,france,234,1237
38,"I think I will go with an army in warsaw, instead of a fleet in Stp, since I broke off the relationship with austria, and england doesn't seem like a threat. IS that good with you or would you preffer me to build in Stp, to get Enland out of the game quickly?",True,1,-3,russia,france,235,1238
38,"Cool- we might be better off with you in the North Sea actually since it opens up the option to convoy to the island next turn. It depends somewhat on English disbands. Warsaw is fine with me- I agree with your logic, and we probably have enough units for England anyway",True,1,3,france,russia,236,1240
38,Great! Thanks mate,True,1,-3,russia,france,237,1241
38,You didn't build a fleet in Sevastopol?,True,1,3,france,russia,238,1258

38,Any ideas for Trieste?,True,1,3,france,russia,244,1269
38,"How is a convoy easily disrupted? You realize that one has to dislodge a unit in order to stop it from convoying. And france can't do that. Although Ig they could stay in edi, but moving to the norwegian wouldn't change anything about that",True,1,-3,russia,france,245,1271

38,I think I have to defend Venice from Austria but I will try to get Austria to make some bad moves,True,1,3,france,russia,259,1293
38,"I could move to Serbia it just means I'll lose Venice and Trieste too and Edinburgh is unfortunately not guaranteed, so I think I'd have to keep Denmark in that scenario to avoid losing 3 supply centers in one turn",False,1,3,france,russia,262,1297

If you didn't want this too be a betrayal, you could have told me and worked something out beforehand.

40,Nothing super interesting. They want me to go into Brest while they attack. I'll try to find out more for ya,True,1,-2,england,france,47,334
40,"Sounds great. Just as a heads up, Germany has been telling me that he would send his fleet in Holland to North Sea if I withdrew from Munich. Probably a lie, but thought I'd mention it.",True,0,2,france,england,48,354
40,"I'm very close with Russia in terms of our relationship, and I just realized that you and Russia can take Denmark from Germany this turn. Is that something you are interested in? I would definitely ask Russia if they can support you into Denmark in the fall when you are in the North Sea",True,1,2,france,england,49,361
40,"Also, any thoughts on how I might keep Munich? Just looking to get a second opinion on things.",True,1,2,france,england,50,362
40,Like if you falsely claim Russia wants to move west this turn,True,1,-2,england,france,51,375
40,"I shall talk to Russia, and I don't know how you'd keep Munich but perhaps some sort of deception regarding Russia's goals may work",True,1,-2,england,france,52,376
40,Great idea! Yeah I'll try to see if that misinformation can be spread,True,1,2,france,england,53,386
40,"Yeah I think Russia is moving to Silesia (wink, wink 😉)",True,0,2,france,england,54,391
40,Oh no! If only there were an army in Munich willing to help out!,True,1,-2,england,france,55,392
40,"I'm very happy to see your moves. Whild convoying London to Denmark is tempting, I think it makes the most sense to send Skaggerak to Denmark for two reasons.",True,1,2,france,england,56,428
40,"Firstly, Russia is the only thing preventing Turkey and Austria from rapid expansion, which is something we need to prevent in case either of them get in a dominant position in the east to the point of soloing, or being too big to take out in the future.",True,1,2,france,england,57,429
40,"Secondly, a fleet in Denmark can support a fleet from the North Sea into the Helgoland Blight, which is important in case Holland tries to bounce that move. Getting that fleet there is necessary if we hope to take Holland or Kiel in the future.",True,1,2,france,england,58,430
40,"By the way, pretty much everything I've told Germany this turn is a lie. Just so you know",False,1,2,france,england,59,449
40,"Can you move your Brest fleet down south? I'd prefer not to leave my backdoor unlocked, and nothing I have will be able to capitalize on that. That said, I'll be moving into Denmark",True,1,-2,england,france,60,451
40,Are you comfortable if it goes to Picardy again? I want to try and corner Belgium.,True,1,2,france,england,61,460
40,"Germany is insisting that you told him that you'd attack me next, which is concerning since I am a logical target, and it's ""pretty much everything"" is a lie",True,1,-2,england,france,62,461
40,Depends.,True,1,-2,england,france,63,462
40,"Look. You helped me out a ton last turn my moving out of the English Channel and building the fleet in Edinburgh. Meanwhile, Germany built 2 armies, used them against me to take a dot from me (I have a disband this turn), and tried to take Picardy. I'm not going to forget that.  I'm not going to attack you right now. And despite how difficult it is to predict the future in this game, I honestly don't see myself attacking you in the future either. Germany is the largest threat to me right now, and I can't overextend against you without worrying about Italy who has a fleet in Rome (which can only move West).",False,1,2,france,england,64,466
40,"Not to mention. You have a build coming and I have a disband. There's no chance I can win in a fight against you. Germany is trying to show discord between us because he knows it's the only chance he has to survive if we start working together. And for the record, I told him I'd be attacking you right now *if and only if* he gives me Belgium (this is a lie, but I'm hoping that I can snag Belgium this turn). I did not say anything about attacking you after splitting up Germany (and in general I like to deal with the present situation instead of making long-term plans, since the board is constantly changing).  I'll be around to talk more later today, but hopefully that assuaged some of your fears",True,1,2,france,england,65,467
40,"Okay. I will continue to support you against Germany. However, I will only accept Brest into Picardy if MAO moves south. You have other things to worry about, but I'm not going to open up my coasts without an insurance policy. I will move into Denmark, ideally with Russian support, and we can see how the situation progresses from there.",True,1,-2,england,france,66,468
40,"If you maintain our alliance for the duration of the conflict against Germany, I will surrender Belgium and Holland to you as well",True,1,-2,england,france,67,470
40,"I will 100% do that if that is what we want to do. I don't mean to push it too much (as I realize just Picardy is a large trust excersize), but in the interest of full disclosure, I was initially planning to send MAO to the English Channel. I wanted to put that on the table as a way to get 3 units on Belgium. If Germany plays his cards correctly there is a high chance I lose Ruhr, and that will make it hard to take Belgium. Again, I know it's a huge ask, so right now I'm sending MAO south unless you allow me to put it in the channel temporarily. If you do allow that, you would have control over what we do with that unit- whether that's convoying London to Belgium, cutting Belgium support to try and capture Holland, or sending it to Belgium with supports from Burgundy and Picardy.",True,1,2,france,england,68,471
40,"I can see why you'd want MAO in EC. As a compromise, you can keep MAO where it is instead of moving south, and maybe EC next. Picardy and EC are two big bites, and being able to take them one at a time would go far in my comfort with that move.",True,1,-2,england,france,69,472
40,"Sounds great! Thanks. Let me know if you find out anything about what Germany plans to do (I will do the same, but at this point I don't think he'd share any reliable info with me).",True,1,2,france,england,70,473
40,Lol Germany is mad at me I don't think I'm gonna get much either,False,1,-2,england,france,71,498
40,I can't imagine he is not telling you anything. He has to be telling you something.,True,1,2,france,england,72,505
40,"If he's telling you that he will give you Denmark, he is lying. You need to support yourself to there",True,1,2,france,england,73,506
40,He offered me Belgium to turn on you thats it,False,1,-2,england,france,74,512
40,He hasn't mentioned Denmark,False,1,-2,england,france,75,513
40,Interesting.,True,1,2,france,england,76,515
40,Do you know what Russia is doing with Sweden?,True,1,2,france,england,77,519
40,"I asked him to support me into Denmark, but he hasn't been replying so idk if he will",True,1,-2,england,france,78,521
40,"Yeah it seems like most of the players are not replying, probably due to the labor day weekend.",True,1,2,france,england,79,533
40,Yeah that makes sense.,True,1,-2,england,france,80,534
40,Germany thinks I'm going to turn on you for belgium.,True,1,-2,england,france,81,535
40,Is he giving you Belgium right now?,True,0,2,france,england,82,539
40,Is he giving you Belgium right now?,True,1,2,france,england,83,540
40,I don't think it's possible for him to give you Belgium unless he makes some wacky moves into the Helgoland Blight and to Holland,True,1,2,france,england,84,541
40,I don't think he is. He believes it'll be a long term exchange,True,1,-2,england,france,85,542
40,Are you online?,True,1,2,france,england,87,592
40,My connection kind of sucks but I'm here,True,1,-2,england,france,88,596
40,What's up?,True,1,-2,england,france,89,599
40,Russia was just saying he'd support you to Denmark,True,1,2,france,england,90,600
40,This changes a lot in terms of plans because one thing you can do now is move North Sea to Helgoland and Norwegian Sea to North Sea,True,1,2,france,england,91,602
40,He wants me to send Nor west so idk if that will fly with him.,True,1,-2,england,france,92,603
40,You'd be able to conviy into Kiel or Holland next Spring and take the other in the fall for two dots,True,1,2,france,england,93,604
40,Yeah he told me he wanted you to put it in Edinburgh,True,1,2,france,england,94,605
40,"I'd be fine with that but it's a regressive move. If anything, Russia is just worried that you'll attack him",True,1,2,france,england,95,606
40,Other option if you want to be safe is we can bounce in the English Channel,False,1,2,france,england,96,607
40,It's slower but we can do all this stuff next year anyway as long as you stay in North Sea,True,1,2,france,england,97,608
40,"I'm glad since Russia's silence was really worrying me, but it seems like he was just away for the weekend",True,1,2,france,england,98,609
40,"Alright that sounds good to me. NWG will go to Edi, North Sea can bounce EC, and Ska will take Denmark.",True,1,-2,england,france,99,610
40,And yeah I was worried too but all is well so that's comforting.,True,1,-2,england,france,100,611
40,Sounds good. Ordered and in,False,1,2,france,england,101,612
40,You may want to move London out of the way since your re going to have a build and I assume you don't want to build in liverpool,True,1,2,france,england,102,615
40,That's a marvelous point thanks for mentioning that.,True,1,-2,england,france,103,617
40,So Russia,True,1,-2,england,france,104,643
40,We probably should have seen that coming since zRussia does honestly really need the build to stop Turkey Austria from rolling over him,True,1,2,france,england,105,645
40,Depending on what Russia says you should decide between spending effort to evict Russia from Norway or letting it go,True,1,2,france,england,106,650
40,Russia said there was a discrepancy between what you're telling and him and what I told him. What did you communicate to him about my moves?,True,1,-2,england,france,107,653
40,I just need to find out if he legitimately thought he was in danger or if he acted with malice.,True,1,-2,england,france,108,655
40,"We talked a lot and pretty fast, so there is a chance some things got lost in translation. But basically I just told him we were bouncing in the channel and we had worked things out",False,1,2,france,england,109,657
40,Alright cool. He went to bed but I'm gonna figure out my move in the morning.,True,1,-2,england,france,110,662
40,Any ideas on what you want your next steps to be? I don't think Russia stabbed you from malice. If anything I think we'll see with Russias builds that he does not want to get into conflict with you,True,1,1,france,england,111,676
40,"If it is possible to work through this, we need to start working on attacking Germany ASAP. Right now it's a clusterfuck and Austria Turkey are going to roll over the West if we don't work together",True,1,1,france,england,112,677
40,"Being deprived of a build really kills my momentum on fighting Germany.  One of my fleets will go into securing Norway, and i'll also try to move against Germany with one of my fleets",True,1,-1,england,france,113,680
40,Edi will probably end up in the North Sea,True,1,-1,england,france,114,681
40,Russia didn't like me having so many fleets near him but he stabbed me so he's gonna have to deal with it lol,True,1,-1,england,france,115,682
40,"If Edi will end up in the North Sea, where is North Sea headed? To Helgoland Blight?",True,1,1,france,england,116,683
40,NS will go Nor,True,1,-1,england,france,117,684
40,Makes sense. I'm assuming you worked it out with Russia since otherwise it would probably bounce,True,1,1,france,england,118,685
40,He said he'd vacate Nor so here's hoping lol,True,1,-1,england,france,119,689
40,"You seem very hesitant to attack either Germany or me. You have to commit to one side at some point though, or else nobody will make any progress while Turkey starts decimating the East and soloes.",True,1,1,france,england,120,690
40,"I would highly recommend letting Russia keep Norway for now because he will need the units against Turkey, and you can always take Norway back later",True,1,1,france,england,121,692
40,"Meanwhile, you have a really good opportunity to take some German centers",True,1,1,france,england,122,693
40,Idk it seems like you aren't worried about Turkey/Austria at all.,True,1,1,france,england,123,699
40,"You should be very worried. Think about them as an 11 center power. They're going to roll over Italy and Russia very, very quickly",True,1,1,france,england,124,700
40,"It seems like you are so far away, so you don't have to worry about it. But the truth is that they don't need a single one of your supply centers for one of them to win the game.",True,1,1,france,england,125,701
40,"As far as I can tell, Turkey is the stronger partner and Austria is mostly just going along with it. I've been trying for the past 2 years to get them to fight unsuccessfully, though you are welcome to try",True,1,1,france,england,126,702
40,If this pattern continues we will see Turkey stab Austria once the solo is in sight,True,1,1,france,england,127,703
40,"It's so much easier to stop right now rather than later. Or in fact, instead of stopping it we could just create a stronger counter-alliance",True,1,1,france,england,128,704
40,That's why I want Russia to be as strong as possible right now to stop the AT in their tracks. If you don't want to do that I think we have to hit Germany hard right now. Maybe you can move to the Helgoland and take Norway in the fall?,True,1,1,france,england,129,705
40,"While I reasonably hesitated to involve myself in the conflict with a Germany, the fact that I have taken Denmark (and intend to continue attacking with the fleet in Denmark) ought to indicate that I'm no longer hesitating to commit. While Turkey/Austria is a significant threat in the late game, I'm also concerned with not being eliminated in the short-term. The fact of the matter is that I am surrounded by powers who can stab me with devastating effect (you) or powers who have in fact stabbed me (Russia) or would stab if given the chance (Germany). I am more than willing to hit Germany right now and move South from Denmark, but I also need to cover my bases and get Nor. Russia can have centers in Germany to combat AT.",True,1,-1,england,france,130,708
40,"I'm willing to be the weaker power in the interest of countering AT, but I am inclined to think that holding Denmark and Nor is a very reasonable minimum.",False,1,-1,england,france,131,709
40,"Very fair, thanks for writing out your thoughts. We'll see what happens but you probably will grow faster than I can. Germany has so many armies that any successful attack on him hinges on you (and Russia to some extent)",True,1,1,france,england,132,711
40,Alright. Where do you want the Danish fleet to move? Has Russia communicated a plan with his armies? I'll communicate to Russia that if I have Norway he can take his picking of German centers to combat AT,True,1,-1,england,france,133,712
40,Makes sense to move it to Kiel I think?,True,1,1,france,england,134,713
40,Yeah I was thinking actually that it would make sense to put Russia into munich,True,1,1,france,england,135,714
40,Russia disappeared again but hopefully we can work that out,True,1,1,france,england,136,715
40,Hey I just told Russia he can keep Nor for now.,True,1,-1,england,france,137,725
40,I really don't want to have to deal with Turkey pushing up to StP or something,True,1,-1,england,france,138,726
40,"Awesome! Russia told me he would build an army in Moscow, so if he guesses right he might be able to keep Turkey out for now",True,1,1,france,england,139,736
40,"Everything looks good right now. If you sill plan to let Russia keep Norway then I would recommend ordering North Sea-Helgoland Blight, Denmark - Kiel, and Edinburgh-North Sea. Best case scenario, you end up in Helgoland Blight, Kiel, and North Sea and can take Holland in the fall for a total of both Kiel and Holland",True,1,1,france,england,140,737
40,"I recommend this because I believe that Germany trusts you and that he will not make an attempt to defend Kiel, especially if you tell him that you have your hands full with Russia and me.",True,1,1,france,england,141,738
40,I hate to ruin the party but there is no chance in hell that Germany trusts me. They have fully stopped replying to me.,True,1,-1,england,france,142,739
40,"That said, I'm sure their hands are full anyway, so I'll move into Kiel",True,1,-1,england,france,143,740
40,"Oh haha. Well, he isn't talking to me either, so I guess he may have given up 😂",True,1,1,france,england,144,741
40,"I need you tell me whether or not the idea I just had is stupid. If Russia trusts the FER alliance, I could totally convoy army to Livonia and support any of the centers neighboring it. Is that even worth proposing or should it stay in my head?",True,1,-1,england,france,145,759
40,Support Russia defending I mean.,True,1,-1,england,france,146,760
40,It's worth proposing but maybe not at this point since it will take a while to set up anyway. That's a great idea for the future I think,True,1,1,france,england,147,761
40,What's your goal with EC?,True,1,-1,england,france,148,808
40,Literally just to take Belgium- after that it will go south or help you if needed,True,1,1,france,england,149,809
40,Alright. I'm gonna trust that since conflict among FER is a bad look given AT,True,1,-1,england,france,150,810
40,Here's a tentative plan: Kiel-Berlin Bohemia-Munich Silesia S Bohemia-Munich Burgundy-Ruhr English Channel S Picardy-Belgium Picardy-Belgium Helgoland-Holland North Sea S Helgoland-Holland,True,1,1,france,england,151,811
40,You have almost nothing to worry about- you can cover London this turn and have a strong chance to get 2 builds,True,1,1,france,england,152,812
40,You are guaranteed Holland under this tentative plan,True,1,1,france,england,153,813
40,Okay sounds good,True,1,-1,england,france,154,814
40,"And unless Germany uses Munich or Ruhr to take Kiel (highly unlikely), you'll get that too",False,1,1,france,england,155,815
40,I'll copy this plan to Russia and we can refine it if necessary then,True,1,1,france,england,156,816
40,Alright. Let me know what Russia's thoughts are,True,1,-1,england,france,157,821
40,Will do.,True,1,1,france,england,158,824
40,Russia said he liked the plan,True,1,1,france,england,159,864
40,Alrighty cool,True,1,-1,england,france,160,866
40,"Darn. If we knew Germany was submitting all hold orders, we could have eliminated him this turn! That being said, this is great progress",True,1,1,france,england,161,890
40,Now we should start talking about next steps. I think now would be a good time to pitch the Livonia thing,True,1,1,france,england,162,892
40,"Any thoughts for builds? Also, any recommendations/requests for my build?",True,1,1,france,england,163,896
40,"I'd love to attack Italy, but I don't want to pull him away from defending Austria/Turkey. It's hard to say if he'd end up getting very angry and throwing supply centers to Turkey. It's a delicate balance",True,1,1,france,england,164,897
40,"I will talk to Russia about Livonia. I don't think this is a good time to attack Italy. It would be better for you to support him in the while Russia, presumably with my support, holds/pushes east. It is also possible for me to send fleets around Iberia into med to help out with supporting Italy. I will be building armies. My fleets will not be super useful in the conflict to come, but armies can help russia a lot.",True,1,-1,england,france,165,899
40,Makes sense. I agree with all of that.,True,1,1,france,england,166,901
40,I sent this to russia,True,1,0,france,england,167,965
40,"I am pretty confident that Austria will support Bohemia to Silesia. For that reason, I recommend: Warsaw S Silesia H  Munich-Berlin Kiel S Munich-Berlin Burgundy-Munich",True,1,0,france,england,168,966
40,New thought: Ukraine-Sevastopol Moscow S Ukraine-Sevastopol Warsaw-Galicia Silesia S Warsaw-Galicia Munich-Berlin Kiel S Munich-Berlin Burgundy-Munich  This move set has all of the advantages of both move sets,True,1,0,france,england,169,969
40,"Anyway, it wasn't clear whether Russia wanted you to move to Livonia or not after my conversation with him, but I think it might be worthwhile to convoy to Denmark to set up for it anyway?",False,1,0,france,england,170,970
40,Sorry about the delay I've been in class all morning. I asked Russia and they were not into it,True,1,0,england,france,171,973
40,Ok. That's a tough spot to be in. So what were you planning to do instead?,True,1,0,france,england,172,974
40,"If you are up for it, I can move to English Channel and Mid Atlantic Ocean, and then convoy Wales to North Africa.",True,1,0,france,england,173,975
40,"I know you recommended earlier that I work with Italy, but lately I haven't been able to get in contact with him. If that continues, I think our best course of action is moving quickly to try and take those centers before Turkey and Austria do.",True,1,0,france,england,174,976
40,I know you are busy- but let's try to nail down a plan before the deadline this time around.,True,1,0,france,england,175,980
40,I'll be back around later in the day.,True,1,0,france,england,176,981
40,Alright I've only got class for another couple of hours today so we can talk then,True,1,0,england,france,177,982
40,I think Italy is a good target if they're not helping the cause,False,1,0,england,france,179,1026
40,Have you heard anything new from Russia?,True,1,0,france,england,180,1030
40,Nothing new or interesting. They want support to kill Germany,True,1,0,england,france,181,1034
40,Sounds good,True,1,0,france,england,182,1036
40,Hello! Would you like to set up that Naf convoy next turn?,True,1,0,england,france,183,1074
40,"I think so. That being said, the timing does feel a little bit off if we do it now. I also don't really know what the deal is regarding Italy, Austria, and Turkey",True,1,0,france,england,184,1075
40,"I really need a build right now, and even though Russia is getting two builds, he seems reluctant to hand off Munich to me as previously discussed. I wonder if it would be possible for Kiel to cut Berlin's support in case Russia gets greedy and tries to support Silesia to Munich?",False,1,0,france,england,185,1090
40,Are you sure he can't be convinced to surrender it to you? If I hit him in Berlin that might breakup FER,True,1,0,england,france,186,1091
40,Have you talked to Russia about Mun today?,True,1,0,england,france,187,1119
40,"Unfortunately not, as I've been very busy with everything that has been going on.",True,1,0,france,england,188,1124
40,Alright based on what he told me he intends to keep it,True,1,0,england,france,189,1126
40,"I can't get a response from him at the moment, but I just told him my intentions to support myself there.",True,1,0,france,england,190,1128
40,Alright. Do you need me to do anything or am I chillin?,True,1,0,england,france,192,1130
40,Kiel to Berlin would be amazing,True,1,0,france,england,193,1131
40,Alright,True,1,0,england,france,194,1132
40,"Thanks for that- it ultimately wasn't necessary. And wow- did not expect to pick up either Rome and Venice, which actually hurts a lot in terms of containing Italy. I'm sure Austria and Italy will be attacking me next.",True,0,3,france,england,195,1133
40,Sorry- forgot to add that cutting Berlin makes me even more comfortable than I already was in swinging the rest of my units towards Italy,True,1,3,france,england,196,1134
40,How do you feel about Russia right now?,True,1,3,france,england,197,1151
40,Seems like our alliance is getting pretty testy but he hasn't responded since Berlin so idk for sure,True,1,-3,england,france,198,1156
40,Well this is awkward,True,1,-3,england,france,199,1196
40,"If you're willing to cooperate, I would be more than willing to surrender German centers in exchange for peace.",True,1,-3,england,france,200,1198
40,"Besides, stuff like Kie or even NTH makes it look like you and Russia are only sort of on the same page.",True,1,-3,england,france,201,1199
40,I am more than happy to coordinate- it honestly has been very busy over the past few days for me so I haven't been able to talk with you or Russia that much.,True,1,3,france,england,202,1201
40,"There's no getting around it: I need builds to fuel a campaign against Italy and Turkey in the south. I'm glad you are looking for an opportunity to make this as amicable as possible- I definitely don't intend on going after the island (hence, sending Brest to MAO rather than the English Channel). On top of not being necessary, your coasts are extremely well defended.",True,0,3,france,england,203,1202

40,If you were going to attack me the time to do it would have been building 2 fleets instead of 2 armies. But the context of that turn was me agreeing to move out of English Channel and attack Italy,True,1,12,france,england,234,1543
40,After that you had a significant unit disadvantage,True,1,12,france,england,235,1544

41,I've heard from Russia and it seemed like he was a solid player and would probably be a good ally for you. The Russia Turkey alliance is one of the strongest on the board.

41,Sorry for my lack of communication - been busy here. I'm leaning towards a fleet at this stage. I don't have anything on England and Germany - Germany says they are tied up and suggest I go after Russia - both things are not going to enlighten anyone who is looking at the board right now.

41,What do you mean there's no solo in sight? lol you're on 15 and there are three free centres in England... I might not be paying much attention to this game but I'd have to be blind and dumb not to see that. Even if there weren't freebies there you could get them elsewhere. You'd have to try harder not to solo from here haha,True,1,-8,turkey,france,78,1432

41,"This game is over, spending more than 2 minutes per season is a waste of time. I'm glad you found the moves interesting though! I cant stop laughing at ""I didn't mean to take Naples"". In my experience, the best way not to take something is to not attack it. That's just what I've found but I guess you've got other methods of not taking something haha, of course you meant to take Naples and of course we both know that this game has been over for a few seasons. It's all the same at this point. Good game, well played. If you're trying to rack up lies with me I wouldn't bother. I have to conclude that that's the only point for all of them the last few seasons or is it just for fun? If its just for fun, carry on, I dont mind. If its for the successful lie counter, Russia is a better option for that I think?",True,1,-8,turkey,france,85,1518
