0,"Germany!  Just the person I want to speak with. I have a somewhat crazy idea that I‚Äôve always wanted to try with I/G, but I‚Äôve never actually convinced the other guy to try it. And, what‚Äôs worse, it might make you suspicious of me.   So...do I suggest it?  I‚Äôm thinking that this is a low stakes game, not a tournament or anything, and an interesting and unusual move set might make it more fun? That‚Äôs my hope anyway.

0,I am pretty conflicted about whether to guess that you were telling the truth or lying about the ‚Äúbrewing lagers‚Äù thing. I am going to take it literally and say üëé even though I don‚Äôt think you meant it deceptively. üòâ,True,1,0,italy,germany,9,121
0,"But I think I can get over ‚ÄúLagergate‚Äù and we can still be friends.   As of right now, I think Austria may be my most reliable ally. I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôd like to play as a Central Trio if you have any interest in that. Thoughts?",True,1,0,italy,germany,10,123
0,"We haven't even passed a season yet and you have a 'most reliable ally'?  I'll consider this proposal but, basically, I'm not going to expose myself to risk from either of you until I've seen a bit of your behavior",True,1,0,germany,italy,11,124
0,"Well, at least I have an idea of who to trust. Obviously, my ideas are subject to change.   I understand your desire to watch behavior before committing to anything. I, personally, am a partner player. I look carefully early in the game for a small group to work with, and then I value loyalty and collaboration. I like to work closely with a tight-knit alliance.   If you prefer to hop and back and forth, or play more of an individual game, then we might not be a good match.   I‚Äôm looking for a loyal ally or two that I can coordinate with and make awesome moves with. Makes the game easier and a lot more fun.",True,1,0,italy,germany,12,132
0,"Just an FYI: I‚Äôve now had both England and France suggest to me that I should move to Tyrolia and France will support me to Munich in the Fall. One saying that to me is not a big deal, but with both mentioning it, my alarm bells are going off. I am concerned about an E/F.   I‚Äôm certainly not moving to Tyrolia. But I just want you to be cautious here. I feel like England and France are working together.",True,1,0,italy,germany,13,151

0,"Did France tell you he was moving to Burgundy, or was that a stab?",True,1,0,italy,germany,16,180
0,"I was not informed of it, no. And England is leading me to believe it's part of a play for Belgium, so if they're working together this might be a trick...  Italy, you seem like a straight shooter, and Austria has confirmed with me about your two's alliance. So I'll confide in you--this is my first ever game of diplomacy, and I think that teaming up with the two of you could help me learn more and have more fun. So, if you're still interested in a central powers alliance, I'm in.",True,1,0,germany,italy,17,188
0,"Okay full disclosure: I'm not very smart, and I accidentally let slip to England that you told me France was plotting to take Munich. I'm sorry for the error but I figured it was better to admit it so you know that England/France may not trust you.",True,1,0,germany,italy,18,222

0,What would you think of helping me take Marseilles in two turns?,True,1,1,germany,italy,22,314
0,"Hi Germany, I‚Äôll certainly consider that. Though, I‚Äôll note: traditionally, Germany would help Italy to Marseilles if the two of them work together there. The reason is that: if I help you to Marseilles, I‚Äôm basically cut off from going west and getting anything myself. So, usually, Germany would help Italy into Marseilles to encourage Italy to come west and Germany would plan to take Paris, Belgium and Brest.",True,1,-1,italy,germany,23,338

0,That‚Äôs the worst!  And I‚Äôm glad to see you‚Äôre so focused on this in your first game. It‚Äôs a really great game if you put in the time and effort!,True,1,-1,italy,germany,29,368
0,You're definitely telling the truth on that one. So can I count on you to move to piedmont this season?,True,1,1,germany,italy,30,379
0,I don‚Äôt think I can afford to move to Piedmont this season. I don‚Äôt really trust Austria to avoid walking through that door if I leave it wide open.   I think you need to get England on board to attack France.,True,1,-1,italy,germany,31,424
0,"That's valid. And actually I was conferring with England and we concluded that it's not really gonna be possible for me to help you take Marseilles this year anyway.   ...what are you and Austria planning for this year, then? I'm willing to tell you my plans in exchange as a gesture of trust.   Have you communicated at all with England or France?",True,1,1,germany,italy,32,426
0,"Hi, are you there?  Just woke up.   England did return my message, but he did not tell me anything substantive so I really don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing. I‚Äôm planning to move towards Turkey.",True,1,-1,italy,germany,33,441
0,"Well, you‚Äôre in trouble. That England move is trouble.   I‚Äôm going to try to convince him to change course. I suggest you be very kind to him, and don‚Äôt burn that bridge. I think your game hinges on turning England around.",True,1,-1,italy,germany,34,480

0,"England just told me that Russia is helping them to take Denmark so that may be a lost cause. Granted, the source for that intel is a serpentine jackal-spawn",True,1,1,germany,italy,36,546
0,"Okay, I‚Äôm reasonably sure that England wants to take the Channel and attack France now.   I believe that you should basically do whatever England asks to help make this happen.

0,What are your plans for this turn? I can't help but notice that Munich is surrounded by foreign armies on three sides...  I wish I could be more helpful but I'm pretty much just treading water right now trying not to lose anything else,True,1,-1,germany,italy,38,656

0,I am pretty sure that England is not attacking you this turn. And I am committed to supporting Munich holding. Make sure you don‚Äôt move Munich so that it can take my support.,True,1,1,italy,germany,41,740

0,"It‚Äôs none of my business, but if you do plan to take Denmark, I strongly recommend you wait until Fall. I think the most important thing for you right now is getting England fully committed against France. If that happens, taking Denmark later will be easy.",True,1,2,italy,germany,50,856
0,"I think me and England are really on the same page at this point regarding France. I'm actually sort of running counter-intelligence for England (and my friends to the south, of course!) with Russia right now.   England and I talked about Denmark too...and it seems like one or the other of Denmark or Belgium should work out for me this year and I'm fine with that",True,1,-2,germany,italy,51,860
0,Great to hear. Thank you.,True,1,2,italy,germany,52,864

0,"I do think a move to Burgundy makes sense for you this turn, and I can‚Äôt imagine Russia attacking you here. He has a serious Austria problem.   I suggest this: Mun - Bur Ruh - Bel Hol Support Ruh - Bel  Ber - Kie  Tell Russia that the last thing in the world you want to see is Austria run him over, and you‚Äôre willing to help keep Russia viable if necessary (you‚Äôre angling for Russia to disband his northern holdings this turn).",True,1,2,italy,germany,54,946
0,"And ask England nicely to support Ruh - Hol, with the explanation that you don‚Äôt plan to ask for Denmark back, but you think it would help you both to diminish France. (You‚Äôll get Den back eventually, but you want England to think you don‚Äôt care about it).",True,1,2,italy,germany,55,947
0,"Thanks, I'll work on these.  ...Why didn't you scooch into the Aegean behind Austria? You could have defended or even held Bulgaria this turn?",True,1,-2,germany,italy,56,954
0,"England and I were talking about your moves for this season--what do you think of convoying Pie into Spa, supporting this with Wes, and then moving Tyr into Pie?",True,1,-2,germany,italy,57,958

0,That‚Äôs not bad.,True,1,2,italy,germany,59,965
0,I was kind of thinking I should pick one or the other of Marseilles or Spain to attack and not tell a soul which one I‚Äôm going after.,True,1,2,italy,germany,60,966
0,Do you really think it‚Äôs important to coordinate?,True,1,2,italy,germany,61,967
0,I do think you‚Äôre best off moving to Burgundy. And there is some chance that we fail this turn. But I think we just take a guess and hope for the best. We‚Äôll get him next turn if not this one.,True,1,2,italy,germany,62,968
0,Okay‚Äîsorry for being nosy! I will try for bur on the off chance it shakes out that way,True,1,-2,germany,italy,63,970

0,Marked as true,True,1,-2,germany,italy,65,972

0,Ha!,True,1,2,italy,germany,67,974
0,"Well, are you willing to humor my question about the Aegean, anyway?",True,1,-2,germany,italy,68,975
0,"Sure. I was thinking of moving that fleet to Ionian. You think a move to Aegean is better? I‚Äôm not really sure, but let‚Äôs talk it through.",True,1,2,italy,germany,69,977
0,"No sorry I meant in hindsight--like this past turn you should have moved to Aeg so that this current turn, when Austria takes Rumania (from Bulgaria), you'd be there to cover Bulgaria so it couldn't get scooped by the Black sea, and potentially you'd just get to take it.",True,1,-2,germany,italy,70,978
0,Not a bad point. I agree.,True,1,2,italy,germany,71,989
0,"Hmmmm, kind of a pointless lie if you ask me, but I won‚Äôt hold it against you. You‚Äôre in a tough spot.",True,1,2,italy,germany,72,1012

0,You are my favorite.,False,1,2,italy,germany,75,1016

0,"You know italy, I think we *do* need to coordinate your move this time--England and I have a shot at either Bur or Mao if one of Marseilles or Spain can be left open for France to fall into. This will improve all of our chances of crushing France quickly.",True,1,-2,germany,italy,80,1045
0,"Okay, I can dig it. What do you want me to do?",True,1,2,italy,germany,81,1046
0,Let me confer with England and get back to you. Glad to hear that though!,True,1,-2,germany,italy,82,1049
0,So...any thoughts on how to approach this?,True,1,2,italy,germany,83,1111
0,"It looks like England's not willing to try for MAO if it means possibly losing the channel. However, they'll bring the NWG fleet around to try for MAO next year.  So if you could keep Marseilles open, it will help me to try and take Burgundy this turn.",True,1,-2,germany,italy,84,1113
0,"If I leave Marseilles open, would you kindly use Burgundy in the Fall to help me take Marseilles? (Likely that means ordering Burgundy to Gascony to cut support)",True,1,2,italy,germany,85,1118
0,Will do.,True,1,-2,germany,italy,86,1120
0,"Okay, so I still have a teensy little bone to pick with you: on the off-chance that Austria wasn't lying and you *did* take Trieste unexpectedly, I sort of worry that I might be next. Are you willing to tell me what your plans are for the Tri unit, or at least to warn me before any move into Tyrolia?",True,1,-2,germany,italy,87,1156
0,"Sure. But, you‚Äôll see from my moves this turn that Austria is lying to you.",True,1,2,italy,germany,88,1168
0,I currently have Tri - Tyrolia. I like the unit there because it sets up an attack on Austria if I ever want to go that route (build A Ven and go east). Do you want me to keep Tyrolia clear?,True,1,2,italy,germany,89,1169
0,I‚Äôll add ‚Äî I would never attack Germany as Italy. Setting myself as a giant column like that is just not defensible. It would be a terrible move.,True,1,2,italy,germany,90,1170
0,Not when that column is not-so-giant and in a turf war with France.,True,1,-2,germany,italy,91,1171
0,oh you mean setting *yourself*,True,1,-2,germany,italy,92,1172
0,"But you could easily pick off, say, Munich and not be a ""giant column""",True,1,-2,germany,italy,93,1173
0,I mean this sincerely: any Germany who does that is a terrible player.   Why would I do that? I would need 2-3 units to hold one center. That is a net negative. And all of your units are doing things that are good for me in containing your neighbors.   I‚Äôve been working hard in this game for you to succeed and knock back France and England. I can say with 100% certainty: I‚Äôm not going to attack you. I‚Äôm going to keep helping you as much as I can.,True,1,2,italy,germany,94,1174

0,*undeniable? That looks better,True,1,-2,germany,italy,97,1177
0,"I mean it sincerely. I think that England will want to coax me to attack you with him after France falls, but I‚Äôd much rather work with you against England.   But first thing‚Äôs first ‚Äî let‚Äôs get rid of France.",True,1,2,italy,germany,98,1178
0,Agreed,True,1,-2,germany,italy,99,1179
0,(On the france part),True,1,-2,germany,italy,100,1180
0,Sorry I won't be able to cut off Gascony this turn...I probably should have just told you my moves; you could have advised me that supporting Mun-Bur was more important than Kie-Ruh,True,1,-2,germany,italy,101,1238
0,No worries. We‚Äôll crack this but eventually.   Here is my suggestion for this turn: Kie - Den Hol S Bel holding Bel S Ruh - Bur Mun S Ruh - Bur Ruh - Bur,True,1,2,italy,germany,102,1240
0,"I think you should suggest to England that he gets Sweden and St Petersburg, while you get Denmark back. That‚Äôs only fair, as you have been a loyal ally in the fight against France and you plan to continue to do that.",True,1,2,italy,germany,103,1241
0,"The moves I had already planned differ in one respect: I thought it would be worth the risk to try moving Hol-Bel and therefore move Bel-Bur. Even if me and France are high-fiving in Bel for a few seasons it's still mine, and it's not like Holland has anything better to do while I'm still allies with England.  ...The only reason I'm reluctant to make that agreement with England is that---while I think *you* and I have a good relationship---I really have not talked with Austria much at all, and I'm the next logical target for them when Russia's gone. And anything that's bad for Russia right now is good for Austria.",True,1,-2,germany,italy,104,1245
0,"Hmmmm, I‚Äôm just not sure you should trust England enough right now to leave Holland open and Belgium essentially unguarded.   France is a really good player, and he is no doubt working hard to get England to turn on you. My personal take is that you are better off being a bit more conservative until you have Denmark back and England has moved another fleet towards France. But I can see it either way.",True,1,2,italy,germany,105,1246
0,"With regard to Russia, talk it through with England. What you don‚Äôt want is England taking out Russia and giving you nothing. So, if England agrees to let Russia be for a while, then your plan sounds good. But if England is going to take Sweden, you really should get Denmark back. (I‚Äôm my view)",True,1,2,italy,germany,106,1247
0,"Okay you've convinced me: it's worth figuring out what E's plans are for Russia at least.  And you're almost certainly right, from a rational perspective, about leaving Holland/Belgium vulnerable to England. But I think England really is counting on my assistance in taking France, and because of that and other non-quantifiable reasons I trust them.",True,1,-2,germany,italy,107,1248
0,"Excellent. Obviously you have a much better feel for your relationship with England than I do. Just know that France is persuasive, and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs working on. He stopped talking to me, so I bet he‚Äôs trying to turn England. Just keep reassuring England that you want to work with him long-term so he doesn‚Äôt succumb to the Dark Side.",True,1,2,italy,germany,108,1249
0,"Hi Germany ‚Äî well, I think we‚Äôre getting to a critical point in the game here. France held out a long time, but he‚Äôs much less of a threat now. I think the critical issue, for you, is England.   I have some thoughts on the matter, and some information, but I‚Äôd like to feel confident that you and I will keep anything we say between us. I think of you as the one person who has been honest with me on every turn. You even tell me the truth when it‚Äôs bad news, or when you don‚Äôt completely trust me, and I like that.",True,1,3,italy,germany,109,1368
0,"Okay, Italy. I won't share any of this conversation. But in the interest of continued full disclosure, here's what I think: England is a greater threat to *me* on the map, but *you* have a greater chance of soloing this game quickly, or pair-winning with Austria even sooner. And if I continue to collaborate with England, we at least have a chance of slowing that down. So I'm in sort of a conflicted spot",True,1,-3,germany,italy,110,1370
0,This is why I like you. The full disclosure part. You tell me the truth even when the news isn‚Äôt great.,True,1,3,italy,germany,111,1377
0,"My thoughts on the ‚ÄúGermany/England forever so that at least we can stop the solo‚Äù strategy: (1) It‚Äôs quite early to be talking about solos. I am at 8, and Austria could take 3 from me any time, quite easily. (2) I don‚Äôt think England is thinking that way. I think he‚Äôs thinking that a dominant power will emerge in the north, and one will emerge in the south. And he‚Äôs like to be that dominant power.",True,1,3,italy,germany,112,1378
0,"England‚Äôs pieces are not positioned well if he‚Äôs trying to attack France or contain Italy. He keeps Denmark guarded, and North Sea filled. He is not playing like he intends to stick with you, even though I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs telling you that.",True,1,3,italy,germany,113,1379

0,"I would say something like this:  England, I‚Äôm with you my friend, but we‚Äôre passed the stage of you needing to keep me under lock and key. I need to take Denmark back. I‚Äôm happy to support you to Brest to keep you growing, or you can grab Sweden. You have plenty of options other than keeping your ally‚Äôs center, but if you really want to be my ally long-term, you‚Äôve got to show me that.",True,1,3,italy,germany,116,1382
0,I am hearing from England signs that he may be thinking of attacking you soon. And I think you actually avoid that better by being strong and sticking up for yourself rather than being accommodating and letting him do whatever he wants to do.,True,1,3,italy,germany,117,1383
0,"Well, both you and France have now pointed out that England is strategically not in a good place to be my ally right now, and you are correct.

0,"He did say that to me too. Though, France has a long history of lying to me, so I really don‚Äôt trust him.",True,1,3,italy,germany,122,1391
0,"Well France has actually been pretty honest with me, and I at least am certain that they wouldn't betray me to England.

0,"Hi Germany ‚Äî sorry for the delay. Well...I think it‚Äôs really important that you get a build this turn either way. I don‚Äôt think England will get a build this turn, so if I were you I‚Äôd probably take Paris, build a fleet, and move on England after that.",True,1,3,italy,germany,125,1419

And if you wanted us to be friends, you could have done that without betraying me to England by simply saying in your candid way ""I don't think you should do that for such and such reason"". But you chose to increase E's distrust of me. So I think you might be full of gnocchi and crap.   My trust in you is a bit shaken but I still think we can have a working partnership with a bit more caution on my end. It would be my preference that you hold Mao, on the assumption that if it came down to a choice between partnering with me or England, you'd choose me.

0,"Well, when I initially proposed the deal I had forgotten that Portugal was promised to England.

0,"That‚Äôs a good point, but the problem with that approach is that Brest is not guaranteed. If England cute MAO and supports with the Channel, the attack fails.

3,"Well that‚Äôs fun. Um, where to begin?   I think I‚Äôm a good online player. I‚Äôve been playing online for about two years. I have a site ranking on one website in the Top 100, and I have a site ranking on another website in the top 250. So, maybe if you combine those rankings and squint, I‚Äôd be in the top 200 or so?",True,0,2,italy,england,109,1210
3,"Also, I don‚Äôt know who France is. So, he either has me confused with someone, or else he‚Äôs just trying to scare you. Let‚Äôs see...why would he be trying to scare you?",True,0,2,italy,england,110,1211
3,"And, I have definitely encouraged him to attack you, as I recall, but it‚Äôs been several game years since then. I feel like you‚Äôve probably encouraged France to attack me before (a fairly natural thing for England to do).",True,1,2,italy,england,111,1212
3,"Bottom line: France has every reason in the world to try to get us to distrust each other, and he‚Äôs obviously willing to say whatever to make that happen.",True,1,2,italy,england,112,1213
3,"I think I‚Äôve been really honest with you, and I think we‚Äôve been helpful to each other, and I think we are both going to succeed in this game if we can stick together and not give in to his tricks.",True,1,2,italy,england,113,1214

3,"Also, you should be able to see from my moves, and Austria‚Äôs, that I‚Äôve been telling you the truth.",True,1,2,italy,england,118,1234
3,"Yeah, that's fair. France is funny. I've gotten maybe 15 messages from France since I ghosted him. Is it rock, paper, or scissors against him this season?",True,1,-2,england,italy,119,1262
3,"From France: ""I can stop Italy this turn by the way. It's pretty easy since Italy let me into Marseilles, I can support the hold in Marseilles and Marseilles can support MAO to Spain SC. It's impossible to breach, I've checked it, and I can keep making those orders for years and years. You stabbed me in Spring 03. It is Fall 05. I think that you, Italy, and Germany are highly underestimating my ability to survive against your onslaught. You sure this is the game you want? Slowly whittling away at me until I die? Instead, I propose that we let you into the Mid Atlantic Ocean and that you help me defend Italy. I can send you past the MAO into West Med, where you can start taking dots like Tunis or Naples. We wait until AI crumbles, and you have an excellent game where you top the board.""",True,1,-2,england,italy,120,1267
3,"So I have my interpretation of the message, but I'm curious to hear yours",True,1,-2,england,italy,121,1269
3,"Hmmm, thanks for sending that. I mean, obviously the orders he proposes can be defeated by tapping Marseilles and supporting into Spain. He knows we know that. He‚Äôs just playing games and trying to throw us off.",True,1,2,italy,england,122,1277
3,Yeah. Maybe it's not even worth thinking about. It's like the Sicilian in princess bride,True,1,-2,england,italy,123,1278

3,I‚Äôm just going to flip a coin.,True,1,2,italy,england,125,1280

3,Sure.,True,1,2,italy,england,130,1286
3,"Well, I'm surprised you haven't been opinionated at all about my actions in Russia.",True,1,-2,england,italy,131,1287
3,"Hmmm, well, I do have opinions. I just don‚Äôt want to be overbearing.",True,1,2,italy,england,132,1288
3,What are you thinking over there?,True,1,2,italy,england,133,1289
3,"The builds are tempting, but I don't want to be the one that hands austria the game",True,1,-2,england,italy,134,1290
3,What are your opinions?,True,1,-2,england,italy,135,1291
3,"I'm going to bed. But other things I want to talk about are 1) the anti-English moves from Germany, 2) what you're doing with the Tyr unit.",True,1,-2,england,italy,136,1292
3,Responding now.,True,1,2,italy,england,137,1294
3,"You are thinking about the right considerations re Russia/Austria. Every build is enticing, but you have to consider the cost. Right now, Russia is basically using all of his units to help you. So, I think you might be better off foregoing that build and keeping Russia on your side for now.",True,1,2,italy,england,138,1295
3,But...I certainly have no horse in that fight.,True,1,2,italy,england,139,1296
3,"If you want to attack Russia, no need to hold back on my account.",True,1,2,italy,england,140,1297

3,The Russian units are doing things you want them to do right now.,True,1,2,italy,england,142,1299
3,"Re Germany, I hadn‚Äôt really noticed the anti-English moves. She keeps telling me that y‚Äôall are very close.",True,1,2,italy,england,143,1300
3,"I feel pretty confident that she‚Äôs with you, and that she really wants to see France out of the game.",True,1,2,italy,england,144,1301
3,"Re Tyrolia, what would you like me to do? I do have a plan with that unit. And if you wanted to deal a blow to Austria, I can think of at least one devious plan to make his turn go poorly.",True,1,2,italy,england,145,1302
3,"All that makes sense and I believe it. I feel like your ""horse"" in the russian front is Austria's future strength, which could pose a threat to you. Your advice to me is consistent with that.",True,1,-2,england,italy,146,1303
3,"Yeah, that‚Äôs true. I just don‚Äôt want to be too nosy or high maintenance, really.",True,1,2,italy,england,147,1304
3,"I could see you feeling like you need to get some builds promptly, and so you pick off a Russian unit or two. Even though that may make my situation tougher, I feel like your cooperation against France and later Germany means too much to me for me to try to dictate what you do with Russia.",True,1,2,italy,england,148,1305
3,I hope that makes sense.,True,1,2,italy,england,149,1306
3,"But my advice about what you should do really is my opinion about the best way to approach it from your perspective. I don‚Äôt think you need to be in a hurry there. I think that just about every place on the board is moving in a positive direction for you right now, and so, if I were you, I would not want to shake that up.",True,1,2,italy,england,150,1307
3,"But if you do want to do that, it‚Äôs very much okay with me.",True,1,2,italy,england,151,1308
3,"Yeah I'm not going for Russia right now. Supposing he can hold the stalemate, he's literally just saving those territories for me to take at a later date. I will get a little annoyed if the admin cuts us off at 1910 though, as I think my endgame is a little past that.",True,1,-2,england,italy,152,1309
3,"The anti-english moves aren't strictly anti-english. But a fleet build in Berlin and then moving to Kie is a little aggressive.  Germany hoped I would just give up denmark this fall, and that was her explanation of the kie move. Eventually that Kie fleet will be going against me. A stab right now from germany doesn't seem to make much sense though.",True,1,-2,england,italy,153,1310
3,"It would have to be coordinated with france to even have a chance, and with the pressure you're putting in the south I don't know how France could afford that. Unless he's really pissed at me and goes for a kamikaze just to annoy me.",True,1,-2,england,italy,154,1311
3,And what devious thing could you do with Tyr that wouldn't immediately begin aggressions with austria?,True,1,-2,england,italy,155,1312
3,Ok now I'm really going to bed. But I can think of a Tyr move that would really stir up some trouble. I wonder if we're thinking of the same one.,True,1,-2,england,italy,156,1313
3,Any chance you are around this morning?,True,1,2,italy,england,157,1323
3,What‚Äôs up?,True,1,-2,england,italy,158,1324
3,"I don‚Äôt want to tell Russia a way to deal Austria a blow because Russia will turn around and tell Austria. But I trust you, so I think I could pass on some info to you and you might not use it against me.",True,1,2,italy,england,159,1325
3,Gotcha. What are the moves you‚Äôre thinking?,True,1,-2,england,italy,160,1326
3,"You might say something like this to Russia:  I was chatting with Italy about Tyrolia, and he told me that he promised to use Tyrolia to help Austria. My best guess is that Tyrolia and Galicia will bounce in Vienna. If you just use Bohemia to support Tyrolia in, then Austria doesn‚Äôt get a build and you likely break up Italy and Austria.",True,1,2,italy,england,161,1327
3,Too devious? ü§≠ü§´,True,1,2,italy,england,162,1328
3,"I'd considered this move as something that russia could do to free up Gal, but I think I thought Ser was a home center or something, so I didn't realize the build consequence.",True,1,-2,england,italy,163,1329
3,"I'd bet russia is already planning to do this, but I can make the suggestion",True,1,-2,england,italy,164,1330
3,I did have a different move for Tyr in mind.,True,1,-2,england,italy,165,1331
3,Oh yeah?,True,1,2,italy,england,166,1333
3,"This is not a good idea, i should clarify. But it would be very dramatic if you successfully supported Boh to Mun",True,1,-2,england,italy,167,1334
3,(also I have a feeling russia won't be online before noon unfortunately),True,1,-2,england,italy,168,1335
3,"well, russia had the right idea, but didn't choose the right one to support. Bounce in Ank planned? And congrats on Mar",True,1,-2,england,italy,169,1348
3,"Yes, both bounces planned. Russia made a nice gamble taking Bulgaria.",True,1,2,italy,england,170,1349
3,Even with Austria in BLA now? I'll be a little annoyed if I see a build in St. P,True,1,-2,england,italy,171,1350
3,"Yeah, for sure. Austria loses that build and keeps Vienna vacant. Russia GETS a build. Yeah, I think that worked well for Russia.",True,1,2,italy,england,172,1353
3,"We should start talking about the France endgame and what things look like post-war. Maybe after we see the French choice for a disband. I think France hates me the most (despite me having taken none of his territories) and as a result will probably hold onto Brest until the end, or maybe even go for LVP or something.",True,1,-3,england,italy,173,1360
3,Sure ‚Äî I‚Äôm happy to talk it through. That move by France to bounce NAO was annoying.,True,1,3,italy,england,174,1365
3,"Yeah, I kinda saw that coming. So things are kinda escalating with germany. She‚Äôs making lots of asks that I don‚Äôt think are reasonable. Like ‚Äúwhy not just give me denmark‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy not just leave Nth open‚Äù. She‚Äôs also admitted to being friendly with France.",True,1,-3,england,italy,175,1408
3,"Yeah, I‚Äôm hearing rumblings of the same thing from Germany. Just sort of feeling me out on whether I‚Äôd be okay with her working with France. Not good.",True,1,3,italy,england,176,1417
3,How would you like to address it with moves this turn? Do you want me to support you to MAO? Or should I move there?,True,1,3,italy,england,177,1418
3,"How has she suggested to you that she‚Äôll be helping France? Because if she‚Äôs telling you that, it must mean working with france against me, maybe with something specific in mind. She also wants me to give up Brest haha. Maybe i‚Äôll ask if she wants London",True,1,-3,england,italy,178,1426
3,I don‚Äôt know anything specific. She‚Äôs just asking for my thoughts. I have not responded.,True,0,3,italy,england,179,1427
3,"Though, I‚Äôm not surprised. France is not going to quit. He hasn‚Äôt been talking to me anymore and he hasn‚Äôt been trying to turn you. That means he‚Äôs been working on Germany. I think we just have to keep telling her that France is a Dark Wizard who does not have her best interest in mind.",True,1,3,italy,england,180,1428
3,"Yeah, I mean good on France for being persistent. I'm sure France is telling her that we're allies. And that would actually be the truth. And just geographically it would be hard for me and germany to be allies longer-term, so it's somewhat understandable that Germany could be swayed by that logic.",True,1,-3,england,italy,181,1429
3,What are your thoughts on the timing of war with Germany (if you're keen on a war in the near future at all)? I have an idea of how to handle the situation that's slightly dependent on that,True,1,-3,england,italy,182,1430
3,"Well, I don‚Äôt really want to attack Germany this year. In a perfect world, you and I each get a build this year, and we are in position to attack Germany next year.",True,1,3,italy,england,183,1434
3,"Germany seems to like my advice, so I may be able to get her to take Paris this year and refrain from attacking you. If we can cripple France in the next two turns, without Germany attacking, then next year‚Äôs attack on Germany would be easy.",True,1,3,italy,england,184,1435
3,That is my general thinking in it.,True,1,3,italy,england,185,1436
3,"I mean I don't see how I get a build this year outside of moving in on Russia, but I'd rather stay out for now. Honestly the worst that Germany can do this year is knock me out of the channel.",True,1,-3,england,italy,186,1438
3,So I don't want support into MAO this turn. I might reach out to France with a proposition for survival that I won't follow through with. But maybe I can make it convincing enough that he gives it a shot. Otherwise I'm rather nervous that France gives Germany a big hand with attacking my island in his final years,True,1,-3,england,italy,187,1440
3,"Also, will an attack on Germany really be easy next year?",True,1,-3,england,italy,188,1443
3,"Also, did you tell germany i was plotting against her? She says you did.",True,1,-3,england,italy,189,1456
3,"Whoa ‚Äî no, I want you and Germany to work together.",False,0,3,italy,england,190,1486
3,"I would not and have not said you are plotting against her. She floated the ‚Äúwork with France thing,‚Äù and I suggested that she should really take Paris now while she can.",False,0,3,italy,england,191,1487
3,"You really said nothing to that effect? What would prompt france to say that to me? It‚Äôs ok if you did say something, but i want you to be honest about it.",True,1,-3,england,italy,193,1492
3,Some exciting moves. Will be curious to see where you stand.,True,1,-3,england,italy,194,1499
3,"Hey ‚Äî sorry I‚Äôve been offline since the bot went down. That looks like a pretty aggressive move from Germany. I wonder if France has pocketed her. I do like the move to Paris, but the rest is not good.",True,1,3,italy,england,195,1502
3,Yeahh. It‚Äôs a shame. I mean i‚Äôm aware at this point that the two of you could choose to mow over me. I hope the expanse in northern russia makes you wary of helping germany though.,True,1,-3,england,italy,196,1503
3,Time for survival mode. Will appreciate some advice on tactics if you‚Äôre on my side of this.,True,1,-3,england,italy,197,1504
3,"Yeah, I‚Äôm on your side. I‚Äôll help on tactics, but I think the real key here is getting Germany to flip back. I don‚Äôt see why that move has to be permanent. I think you should tell her something like this: ‚ÄúLook, I see that you are attacking you, but I think it‚Äôs my fault not yours. I should have given you back Denmark. I see that now. And I‚Äôm sorry. I will move out peaceably, and I hope we can work out a new working relationship.‚Äù",True,1,3,italy,england,198,1507
3,"Just say you‚Äôre sorry. She can take it back anyway, might as well offer it back right?",True,1,3,italy,england,199,1508
3,"(And I‚Äôm not saying you have anything to be sorry for, I‚Äôm just trying to brainstorm about what will help you turn her back to your side.)",True,1,3,italy,england,200,1509
3,"I already responded non-angrily, though not specifically what you said. I think a return of denmark could go a long way. Though that border will make things tense, and i don‚Äôt think peace with her could last forever",True,1,-3,england,italy,201,1510
3,One thing I'm curious about: Why would you want Germany and I to be friends? Aren't you better off with both of us fighting? And I can keep Denmark this fall if I give up the channel (which may fall anyways),True,1,-3,england,italy,202,1515
3,"Well, I want to be rid of France. I‚Äôve really been depending on the two of you to help in that project. If England decides to move out of Paris for France, that‚Äôs bad for me.   Also, I don‚Äôt want to see Germany get two builds this turn. But you‚Äôre right, if it‚Äôs inevitable anyway, it‚Äôs not the end of the world.   #teamengland",True,0,3,italy,england,203,1519
3,I sure hope you‚Äôve not been clicking that thumbs down haha. It would be a brutal stab. I suppose i‚Äôve got to place my trust somewhere though. Why choose me instead of germany?,True,1,-3,england,italy,204,1523
3,"You know, if you're able to lend a hand from MAO, I'm actually not in THAT bad of shape. Can I depend on that?",True,1,-3,england,italy,205,1531
3,"1) You‚Äôve been straight with me all game. 2) You have a much better ability to read the board than she does. 3) You‚Äôre on the other side, so you can‚Äôt really stab me, but I could totally see her moving to Tyrolia some time soon. 4) You‚Äôre not in France‚Äôs pocket.",True,0,3,italy,england,206,1532
3,"All good reasons. Also, I think Germany is gonna ghost me, soooo, friends? I need MAO to attack Bre. Can you do that?",True,1,-3,england,italy,207,1534
3,"I will ensure that Brest can‚Äôt hurt you. Not sure yet if I‚Äôll cut that support or get France to do something weird with it, but you can consider that unit non functional this turn. I‚Äôll also see what intel I can gain.",True,1,3,italy,england,208,1541
3,Cool. You really think you can get france to take your advice on Brest?,True,1,-3,england,italy,209,1547
3,And do you have opinions about russia walking into Mun?,True,1,-3,england,italy,210,1550
3,"Re Brest: if I‚Äôm not confident, I‚Äôll just cut that support. I know that one is important to you, and I‚Äôll make sure it‚Äôs taken care of.",True,1,3,italy,england,211,1553
3,"Re Munich: that one never really crossed my mind. But if you can get Russia to do that, it would be awesome. I don‚Äôt want to see Germany get builds here.",True,1,3,italy,england,212,1554
3,"Cool. Any advice on the rest of tactics for my defense? I have my own ideas, but would be curious to hear your opinion",True,1,-3,england,italy,213,1555
3,I‚Äôd probably just use the army to protect Liverpool. I‚Äôd send NAO to Norwegian if the battle is going to be against Germany. And I‚Äôd flip a coin between supporting Channel to Belgium or supporting Denmark holding.,True,1,3,italy,england,214,1558
3,And I wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone the result of that coin flip. There is just no reason to share that info.,True,1,3,italy,england,215,1560
3,Huh. That's way different than what I had in mind.,True,1,-3,england,italy,216,1563
3,"Well, you‚Äôre closer to it than I am. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve taken a much harder look. What am I missing?",True,1,3,italy,england,217,1565
3,"You're not missing anything, but I had a more defensive strategy in mind I guess. I've got some time to think it over. Please do let me know what intel you receive",True,1,-3,england,italy,218,1575
3,"Hi, I have a different ask of the MAO unit actually, if you're around this morning.",True,1,-3,england,italy,219,1638
3,Hey ‚Äî what‚Äôs up?,True,1,3,italy,england,220,1639
3,I want to see whether supporting channel to Bre is an option for MAO you'd consider. And I'd also want to know if Gas support will be cut.,True,1,-3,england,italy,221,1640
3,"Well, have to just be honest here ‚Äî I‚Äôve been working on a larger plan considering your earlier request that I neutralize Brest, and I‚Äôm not sure that change works in the larger scheme.",True,1,3,italy,england,222,1651
3,"More broadly, is there any chance you‚Äôd like to form a trio and work with me and Russia long term?",True,0,3,italy,england,223,1652
3,Why wouldn't you let me in on your larger plan?,True,1,-3,england,italy,224,1653
3,"And does your larger plan include neutralizing Brest, or did it just consider that I asked that? Can you confirm you're neutralizing Brest by attacking it from MAO?",True,1,-3,england,italy,225,1654
3,"Yes, hitting Brest.   I prefer not to share my moves if they don‚Äôt matter to someone else. There is just less chance that something goes wrong, and less chance I end up blaming someone else if something goes wrong.",True,1,3,italy,england,226,1655
3,What do you think about E/I/R as a trio?,True,0,3,italy,england,227,1656
3,"I think you need to justify to me why supporting into Brest isn't an option. I don't see how this could be relevant to some larger plan. Unless the plan is ""don't give England that build, don't show others that I'm supporting England""",True,1,-3,england,italy,228,1658
3,"Wow. Well, you asked me to do something else earlier, and I have spent days trying to fit your earlier request into my move set.",True,1,3,italy,england,229,1660
3,"But, you know what, it‚Äôs more important to me to have you as an ally. So I‚Äôll support you to Brest.",True,1,3,italy,england,230,1661
3,"So, confirmed, MAO supporting Channel to Brest.",True,1,3,italy,england,232,1665
3,Test.,True,0,3,italy,england,233,1666
3,It‚Äôs not a secret. It‚Äôs just that I like to keep my moves secret unless they matter to someone.,True,0,3,italy,england,234,1667
3,Can you confirm whether support from Gas is cut as well?,True,1,-3,england,italy,235,1670
3,I am not currently cutting support in Gascony.,True,1,3,italy,england,236,1672
3,Ok. And I'm down to chat about russian relations after the move. Sorry for the last-minute change here. But germany's been putting pressure on me,True,1,-3,england,italy,237,1674
3,Have to say ‚Äî I expect Germany to use Paris to support Brest. Those two seem to be in lockstep now.,True,1,3,italy,england,238,1677
3,Are you sure that I should just take Portugal to drop England down to 1 unit?,True,1,3,italy,england,239,1678
3,I mean drop France down to 1 unit.,True,1,3,italy,england,240,1680
3,"France is just going to bounce you out, right? What else does it make sense for the Spa unit to do?",True,1,-3,england,italy,241,1682
3,"He thinks I am supporting an attack on Spain and moving to Burgundy, so I think his moves look like this:  Spain hold Gas S Spa holding Paris S Brest Brest S MAO - Channel (he asked me to take it) Irish - Liv",True,1,3,italy,england,242,1686
3,"Hmm, yeah I would have thought he would assume the Gas support would be cut. Does France really hate you the least?",True,1,-3,england,italy,243,1695
3,"Yeah, I think France trusts that I‚Äôm actually going to Channel and Burgundy here.",True,1,3,italy,england,244,1700
3,"I feel like you, Germany, and France: if I tell anyone anything, it circulates to all three.",True,1,3,italy,england,246,1704
3,Yeahh. I maybe should keep my mouth shut more often.,True,1,-3,england,italy,247,1705
3,"Germany says that the Brest thing relates to Denmark.   Anyway, what should we do?",True,1,3,italy,england,248,1708
3,It does. I'm giving up denmark for support to Brest.,True,1,-3,england,italy,249,1709

3,Told you about the move to Por btw,True,1,-5,england,italy,254,1730
3,You were right. Thank you.,True,1,5,italy,england,255,1735
3,"Well I'm glad to see the takedown work out. I suppose France has one more unit, but Por will fall next year. And now things get even more interesting. Signing off for now.",True,1,-5,england,italy,256,1737
3,"Hmmm, interesting French disband. He wants me to support him to Brest. Have to believe he‚Äôs going to have Germany on his side given the German fleet build.   Thoughts on how to approach this? We should be able to defeat them if we stick together.",True,0,5,italy,england,257,1773
3,"I think we should focus on getting your army to Pic this turn, and I can support you to Paris in the Fall.",True,0,5,italy,england,258,1782
3,"DO NOT DISCUSS PLANS WITH GERMANY THIS TURN. Seems very clear that she‚Äôs coming for you based on the build and the French disband. I don‚Äôt think we help ourselves by speaking with her. Let‚Äôs just get you into Paris, secure North Sea, and get moving.",True,0,5,italy,england,259,1784
3,"I don‚Äôt need any builds in the North. If I get bigger, I‚Äôll have a target on my back. So I‚Äôm just going to help you get up to my level.",True,0,5,italy,england,260,1786
3,"Also, I need to decide to work with Russia or Austria in the East. What‚Äôs your preference?",True,0,5,italy,england,261,1787
3,"I'll be in communication with Germany, but I'll agree to not share any specific plans discussed between the two of us this turn. Is that fair?",True,1,-5,england,italy,262,1788
3,Yes of course. I don‚Äôt mean that you shouldn‚Äôt talk to her at all.,True,1,5,italy,england,263,1789
3,"At first glance, I prefer an alliance with Russia, though I understand this means you breaking a relationship with Austria. Mostly this is because Russia can threaten me if he ever goes north. What's your preference?",True,1,-5,england,italy,264,1790
3,"Well, that‚Äôs fine with me. I like Russia. But here is the downside for you: if Russia grows, the north won‚Äôt be undefended any more, and you will have less room to grow. So, think long term, and think about where your dots are going to come from. I mean it sincerely when I say that I‚Äôll join up with either one provided you feel good about it, but I actually think it might be better for you if I give back Austria a couple of centers and position you to grab Swe and STP once Germany is on her heels.",True,0,5,italy,england,265,1793
3,Those are good points. I suppose you'd like to commit to this before moves this evening?,True,1,-5,england,italy,266,1801
3,*commit one way or the other,True,1,-5,england,italy,267,1802
3,"Yeah, I think we should make a plan.",True,1,5,italy,england,268,1804
3,I‚Äôd like to have your final thoughts on A/R as quickly as possible so that I have time to execute a plan. But I understand if you want time to think about it.,True,1,5,italy,england,269,1805
3,"How is Germany treating you right now? Did she tell you about that fleet build before it happened? Seems like a bad sign, and North Sea is awfully exposed.",True,1,5,italy,england,270,1806
3,"Oh she told me that she plans to line the whole northwest coast with fleets because ""they're more versatile there"". But all they can do from the northwest coast is invade me.",True,1,-5,england,italy,271,1807
3,She also said she wants Brest eventually.,True,1,-5,england,italy,272,1808
3,Not sure if I can keep Nth this year. We'll see if I can keep it friendly. That involves lots of talk about moving against you. She wants to see me in MAO.,True,1,-5,england,italy,273,1809
3,"Yeah, look, I don‚Äôt mind if you tell her that you‚Äôre moving against me. I am telling her that I‚Äôm moving against you.   Let‚Äôs please make the following deal: You and I both plot with Germany as if we‚Äôre attacking each other. And we both share the plan with Germany against the other guy with each other, and we pledge to tell Germany (and France if he asks) that you and I are not talking much, we don‚Äôt trust each other, and we don‚Äôt have any plan in place.",True,1,5,italy,england,274,1810
3,"This turn will work best if we share all info that we learn from G/F, and we pledge to keep our own talks secret.",True,1,5,italy,england,275,1811
3,"I think that we can pull off a great turn, but it won‚Äôt work if G/F get catch wind of our alliance.",True,0,5,italy,england,276,1812
3,"All that makes sense. I'm on board. You know, if Germany just stopped surprising me with aggressive moves, she may have won my favor. [sigh]",True,1,-5,england,italy,277,1813
3,"And I think Austria is the ally we choose. If we hold off Germany, she can only expand into Russia, which would be her only friend. And the trusting relationship you have makes it more likely that things will go through.",True,1,-5,england,italy,278,1815
3,üëå,True,0,5,italy,england,279,1816
3,"So, here is the plan that Germany is telling me:  She wants to ensure she gets North Sea. So she is asking for this:  Den S Bel - North Bel - North Hol - Bel Pic - Channel Spa - Gas Par S Sap - Gas MAO - Irish",True,0,5,italy,england,280,1817
3,"She wanted me to support her direct from Paris to Brest, but I convinced her that you would likely fear a forced disband, so you were likely to try to keep me out of Gascony (thus Par S Spa - Gas).",True,0,5,italy,england,281,1818
3,"I don‚Äôt think we can save North Sea this turn, but if we can land your army in Pic, we can force France to retreat to Belgium, which would be absolutely awesome. And I think his survival instinct would kick in at that point, and he would stay there until you take it.",True,0,5,italy,england,282,1819
3,I may be able to save Nth with some diplomacy. Is it worth me trying to make Germany a hard case to be on my side? Does that just make her moves less predictable?,True,1,-5,england,italy,283,1820
3,So I would suggest this: Bre S Wal - Pic Wal - Pic Channel Convoy Wal - Pic  That means Germany will lose Paris and Belgium this year. And I think you can defend your territory even with G in North Sea.,True,0,5,italy,england,284,1821
3,"I really think that we are best off not suggesting that you and I are talking. If Germany gets any idea that I shared her plans with you, we‚Äôll have no idea what they are going to do.",True,0,5,italy,england,285,1822
3,"Uhh, Germany will just hop into one of my home centers from Nth in the fall...",True,1,-5,england,italy,286,1823
3,"I trust you at this point, but I don‚Äôt think that confronting her is the best move here.",True,0,5,italy,england,287,1824
3,"No, you can defend.",True,1,5,italy,england,288,1825
3,Oh move  to Cly?,True,1,-5,england,italy,289,1826
3,Oh wait Nth just  retreats. whoops,True,1,-5,england,italy,290,1827
3,"You can move NAO to Norwegian in Spring, and retreat North to Norway. Then in Fall you cover London with Channel while I support you to Paris.",True,0,5,italy,england,291,1828
3,Right.,True,1,5,italy,england,292,1829
3,"So you have coverage for every center, and you get the build, while G loses two.",True,0,5,italy,england,293,1830
3,Thoughts on a retreat to Hel?,True,1,-5,england,italy,294,1831
3,That‚Äôs the best I can come up with if G is being honest with me.,True,0,5,italy,england,295,1832
3,"I would not be opposed to a retreat to Hel, but  it depends a lot on what the board looks like. I‚Äôm not crazy about Germany taking Norway. We want her taking units off the board.",True,0,5,italy,england,296,1833
3,Well I'll at least communicate with Germany to the point that she thinks I'm genuinely against you. But I won't ask for any favors.,True,1,-5,england,italy,297,1835
3,"If I do I'll let you know, and we should expect that you hear about them.",True,1,-5,england,italy,298,1837
3,"Agreed. Yes, I‚Äôm totally fine with that. We want G thinking that we‚Äôre working against each other.",True,1,5,italy,england,299,1840
3,"And, frankly, she‚Äôs going to be pissed at me after this move, so I wouldn‚Äôt mind if you lied to her too at the same time to spread that out a bit.",True,0,5,italy,england,300,1842
3,"So plot away against me, but tell me what plan you guys work out, so we can talk about what she‚Äôs most likely to do.",True,0,5,italy,england,301,1843
3,France wants me to go for MAO. I'm going to say I'm on board with that. I'll say NAO is going there.,True,1,-5,england,italy,302,1846
3,I mean germany,True,1,-5,england,italy,303,1847
3,Yep. That makes sense. She wants Edi and Norway clear.,True,1,5,italy,england,304,1849
3,"Also, does it matter so much if Germany is mad at both of us? Isn't it basically war in the Fall?",True,1,-5,england,italy,305,1850
3,"If I were you, I‚Äôd order NAO to Norwegian. From Norwegian, you have a play to defend Norway AND Edi. Which means you could retreat to Helg if you like and you have a 50/50 to defend Norway or Edi.",True,0,5,italy,england,306,1851
3,Yeah that's what I'll order,True,1,-5,england,italy,307,1852
3,"Re G being mad: it‚Äôs not the end of the world. I mean, we‚Äôll definitely be at war with her. I just don‚Äôt want her trying to throw the game in spite or anything like that. Cause I am lying to her like crazy this turn. ü§≠ü§´",True,0,5,italy,england,308,1853
3,yeahh... it happens. i've been fortunate to not really have to lie so far.,True,1,-5,england,italy,309,1854
3,What are your thoughts on Mun?,True,1,-5,england,italy,310,1856
3,"Also, just out of curiosity, did you advise Germany to build the Kiel fleet?",True,1,-5,england,italy,311,1857
3,I absolutely did not advise G to build the F Kie.,True,1,5,italy,england,312,1858
3,We did not talk at all about that build.,True,1,5,italy,england,313,1859
3,Thoughts on Mun? What do you mean?,True,1,5,italy,england,314,1860
3,"If G would have asked, I would have said that two armies would make me a bit uncomfortable, but I would not have insisted on a fleet, as two armies would have been more anti-Russian than anything. But she did not ask me.",True,1,5,italy,england,315,1861
3,"I believe you. I just was curious. And I didn't look closely enough at Mun. Ber can just support. But I thought it might be interesting to work with Russia there, even if Russia isn't the long-term ally.",True,1,-5,england,italy,316,1862
3,"Also, who does germany think the third ally is?",True,1,-5,england,italy,317,1863
3,I ask because we may be interested to know whether Germany will try to sneak into Swe or not.,True,1,-5,england,italy,318,1864
3,"Well, I‚Äôm not next to Munich now, so there isn‚Äôt much I can do about that. Maybe in the Fall.",True,0,5,italy,england,319,1865
3,Germany and I have not discussed a third ally. She doesn‚Äôt give the impression that she cares much about the east.,True,1,5,italy,england,320,1866
3,"I guess the question in spring is whether you move to Tyr. And would we want her moving into Russia? If she goes east and annoys her future only friend on the board, this might complicate their future relations.",True,1,-5,england,italy,321,1867
3,"Well, that‚Äôs a great idea. I am all for her moving on Russia if you can accomplish that. I‚Äôm certainly willing to go to Tyrolia.",True,1,5,italy,england,322,1868
3,"Alright. I'll plant the seed about anti-russia stuff. If she thinks you're a friend, though, she may listen to you more than me.",True,1,-5,england,italy,323,1882
3,"FYI, she just asked me if I am talking with you. I told her: ‚ÄúI am wary of England right now. He just asked me what I want to do this turn. I feel like he‚Äôs trying to get me to leave MAO open.‚Äù",True,1,5,italy,england,324,1884
3,Cool. consistent with my messaging. I'm talking about a plan to leave Bre open and get her support to Gas so I can support into Spa. I'm asking for her to promise Bre to France and then bounce in Bre instead.,True,1,-5,england,italy,325,1888
3,"Then I'd dislodge in MAO and you'd retreat to IRI. We'll see what she thinks. I imagine she's just playing along, But I need to make specific plans to be believable",True,1,-5,england,italy,326,1889
3,üíØ,True,1,5,italy,england,327,1893
3,Looks like germany is staying friendly with russia. Can we go over moves one more time so i can be sure we‚Äôre on the same page?,True,1,-5,england,italy,328,1911
3,Here is what I have down right now: MAO S Brest WES S MAO LYO - TYR S Spa - Gas Pie - Mar Ven - Tyr Nap - ION,True,0,5,italy,england,329,1913
3,Cool. All expected. Right now I'm: NAO to NWG NTH hold Wal to Pic Channel convoy wal to pic Bre support Wal to Pic,True,1,-5,england,italy,330,1917
3,"I like it.   As I think about it more, you may be better off moving North to Holland, expecting a bounce there. I think you‚Äôre slightly better off keeping the German fleet in Kiel, as it‚Äôs one less German unit in North Sea, but it‚Äôs not a huge difference either way.",True,0,5,italy,england,331,1926
3,That's good advice. I'll take it,True,1,-5,england,italy,332,1927
3,I‚Äôm kind of excited about this turn.,True,1,5,italy,england,333,1928
3,A stab is always exciting,True,1,-5,england,italy,334,1930
3,"I‚Äôm sorry mate. You‚Äôve been a terrific ally. First class all the way. But on this turn, Germany made the kind of offer I could not refuse, and so I went for it.",True,0,5,italy,england,335,1948
3,"I know that doesn‚Äôt make it any easier, but I really mean it when I say that you‚Äôve played a strong game, and been an excellent ally.",True,1,5,italy,england,336,1950
3,"No worries, nicely played on your end. I think I can top Germany‚Äôs offer if you‚Äôre interested. Let me know!",False,1,-5,england,italy,337,1951
3,Hmmmm...I‚Äôm intrigued. Aren‚Äôt you supposed to be screaming obscenities at me right now?This response is downright classy and sportsmanlike.,True,1,5,italy,england,338,1952
3,"Haha yeah I suppose. But this game for me is about learning. I‚Äôm relatively new to the game, and I volunteered for the study 1) to help out my friend, and 2) to prep for an in-person game I have on August 11. So if I get the right experience from this game and do well in the in-person game (i.e. win bragging rights among my friends), I‚Äôve won MY game. Here is my offer: You bring me along to second place, I vow to help you solo as Italy, and you teach me how you pulled it off. What do you say?",True,1,-5,england,italy,339,1953
3,Well that is a better offer than Germany‚Äôs. One of the best offers I‚Äôve ever received. And I really mean it when I say that you‚Äôre a joy to play with and a strong ally. I‚Äôd be happy to teach you as much as I can.,True,1,5,italy,england,340,1954
3,I suggest you retreat to Skagerrak to put maximum pressure on Germany.,True,1,5,italy,england,341,1955
3,"Well i‚Äôm happy to learn if you‚Äôre willing to teach. Do we have a deal then? This is obviously something you‚Äôll have to trust me with. But I haven‚Äôt lied tp you yet and don‚Äôt intend to. And i imagine you can tactically keep me in a position where i‚Äôm not a threat. Also, on the teaching side of things I may have some questions about earlier in the game to learn how you set things up (and I would expect genuine answers!)",True,1,-5,england,italy,342,1956
3,"And yeah, that retreat makes sense. You think norway and the home island are too defensive?",True,1,-5,england,italy,343,1957
3,I‚Äôll answer anything you ask honestly.,True,1,5,italy,england,344,1958
3,"You have more options from Skag, and she can‚Äôt cover them all. You have a much higher upside from there, and it might be worth it for you to take Sweden to avoid having to disband.",True,1,5,italy,england,345,1959
3,"Regarding your offer: it may be hard to put you in second place, frankly. If your units are doing things that help me, then I‚Äôll try to keep your units on the board, and I definitely won‚Äôt allow you to be eliminated, but it‚Äôs really hard for me to ensure that you place second.",True,1,5,italy,england,346,1960
3,I can settle for survival. Deal.,True,0,-5,england,italy,347,1961
3,"Your reasoning on Skag makes sense. Going to bed now. First question on strategy is: how frequently dp you tell lies, and what are the typical circumstances?",True,1,-5,england,italy,348,1962
3,"Hmmm, well, you know, we‚Äôll have statistics to help answer that question at the end of the game. I‚Äôd say that I am mostly honest, and I place a lot of value on my credibility. I‚Äôm not going to lie about my moves to someone unless I am going to get a huge advantage out of it. But I spend most of the game trying to make everyone else on the board feel that I‚Äôm their closest ally, so a lot of what I say is a shade on the truth.",True,1,5,italy,england,349,1963
3,"So, I found it hard to decide whether to use a thumbs up or thumbs down quite a lot. Most of the time, there is some truth in what I‚Äôm saying, but I am trying to persuade the other player to do something for reasons I am not telling them.",True,1,5,italy,england,350,1964
3,"So, in general, I‚Äôm not afraid to lie, but I am very afraid of getting caught lying. I try to preserve my credibility as best I can, but if I am setting up a stab, I will tell some serious whoppers.",True,1,5,italy,england,351,1965
3,"Also, that thing France said about my past successes: that was true. I do have a lot of experience and I have had a fair amount of success playing online diplomacy. I just did not want you thinking of me that way.",True,1,5,italy,england,352,1966
3,"I‚Äôll also note, just cause I have nobody else to talk with about this: I worked REALLY hard on this last move. Germany wanted to take Brest, but if that happened, it would have cut support and prevented your army from leaving your island. So I had to convince Germany to support France to Brest, without telling her the real reason why. And I needed you to go to NAO so that you could not guard Liverpool. There were so many lies!ü§ûüò±",True,1,5,italy,england,353,1967
3,And that doesn‚Äôt even include the East!,True,1,5,italy,england,354,1968
3,"To be completely honest, I directed just about everyone else‚Äôs moves on that turn! Russia is the one exception, but I basically knew what he was going to do. The best advice I have for someone who wants to get better at Diplomacy: just work hard. You can win by putting in more time and effort than everyone else. I have success by writing a lot to everyone all the time.",True,1,5,italy,england,355,1969
3,"Yeah that‚Äôs one thing about online diplomacy I have mixed feelings about. It seems like there‚Äôs definitely a benefit from putting a lot of time in. I feel like I‚Äôve been putting a lot of time in as it is, but there‚Äôs been the temptation to put in more. For in-person everybody gets the same amount of time to chat, which can be an equalizer in some ways.",True,1,-5,england,italy,356,1972
3,"I had considered what a stab from you might look like before it happened, and I was like ‚Äúis he really going to all that trouble‚Äù but I suppose you were. Care to share why you chose Germany and how early you made that choice? What was the ‚Äúoffer‚Äù?",True,1,-5,england,italy,357,1973
3,And that‚Äôs cool that i‚Äôm playing with a champ!,True,1,-5,england,italy,358,1974
3,"Hi England ‚Äî so I see that you retreated to Norway. Not what I expected, but it can work. Would you still like to work with me?",True,1,5,italy,england,359,2066
3,"Yeah i know we didn‚Äôt chat about this. It was a little last minute, and you hadn‚Äôt responded in the morning so I didn‚Äôt think you were around (also I thought Ska was more a suggestion). I should have given you a heads up. My thinking was 1) it‚Äôs going to Sweden anyways, 2) i thought it might help warm relations with germany. Was this a bad call?",False,1,-5,england,italy,360,2074
3,I would still like to work with you,True,0,-5,england,italy,361,2075
3,Not a big deal at all.,True,1,5,italy,england,362,2081
3,"I suggest that you take Sweden, and I‚Äôm working on getting Belgium this turn too. It‚Äôll be tricky to keep Germany from defending it, but I‚Äôm going to try.",True,1,5,italy,england,363,2082
3,Pic to Bel?,True,1,-5,england,italy,364,2084
3,And you were a bit shy about the earlier learning question. I guess it may be something sensitive to give an honest answer to at this time. One other question I have is whether there's a mistake you've seen in my play that you think I could have done differently. Like choosing to cold-shoulder France or choosing not to sneak into Sweden earlier.,True,1,-5,england,italy,365,2089
3,"Also, France is asking about our relations after the stab. What would you like me to say?",True,1,-5,england,italy,366,2102
3,Something about how awful I am and how much you want revenge?ü§≠,True,1,5,italy,england,367,2114
3,Haha alright. I‚Äôll keep you ‚ÄúaBrest‚Äù of how France will move that fleet (should he choose to share),NOANNOTATION,0,-5,england,italy,368,2115
3,"Okay, I think we have a good move brewing!",True,1,5,italy,england,369,2129
3,"If you‚Äôre sincerely on board, this will be fun!",True,1,5,italy,england,370,2130
3,France is ordering Brest to Channel.  Germany is ordering Burg S Bel and convoying Holland to Yorkshire....!,True,1,5,italy,england,371,2131
3,So here is the move: Norway - Swe Pic S Channel - Belgium Mar - Bur to cut support Gas to Bre to block the Paris move.   I think you‚Äôre going to get a build this turn even if I take Liverpool.   Does that make sense?,True,0,5,italy,england,372,2133
3,"Yeah I'm on board, though I will remind you that you're forgetting an important part of the bargain. So I guess NWG to Edi (which is probably safe in case she goes for the build instead) and then plan to build in London?",True,1,-5,england,italy,373,2152
3,What part of the bargain am I forgetting? It‚Äôs unintentional. I‚Äôm trying to be helpful!,True,1,5,italy,england,374,2154
3,You overlooked a couple of my questions.,True,1,-5,england,italy,375,2155
3,"I'm sure you've been busy setting up that move, so it's no big deal, just wanted to remind you",True,1,-5,england,italy,376,2157
3,Sorry.,True,1,5,italy,england,377,2163
3,You asked a question about what Germany offered me. Do you mind if I answer that after this move? I‚Äôd just like to see for sure that you‚Äôre sincere in working with me after I so rudely stabbed you.,True,1,5,italy,england,378,2164
3,Yeah that one's fair to skip for now I think.,True,1,-5,england,italy,379,2165
3,"Germany is now fishing for info from me about our relationship. Does she know that we are still talking? I‚Äôd like to tell her that you‚Äôre mad at me and you will tell me nothing, but we must keep our stories straight.",True,1,5,italy,england,380,2166
3,"No, but I'd bet she'd assume it. We didn't have much to say to each other this morning. I tried to be friendly but she was kinda straight up about saying that an alliance wasn't going to work out. And I sent a message back but haven't heard anything. So I'd imagine she'd think I'm not just sitting here twiddling my thumbs. Up to you how to spin it though.",True,0,-5,england,italy,381,2177

But launching an ineffective attack on England while Italy eats me from behind in the hopes that eventually Italy soloes even though he's going to get stopped at the stalemate lines because Italy just has to be friends with England? Not a fan. If there's a way forward it's with you sending a fleet to MAO and putting your fleets past the lines.

7,"Yeah, I think on balance I have to give him the option to follow through, and have a reason to deescalate with me so he can join the dogpile on France.  Odds are high I'm going to regret the decision and end up offering you that support in the Fall when you can't reciprocate, but I gotta take the chance with Austria obviously spoiling for a fight.",True,1,3,russia,germany,21,886

7,Are you and England planning to high-five in Sweden and Norway again this turn?  I still think supporting Rumania into Gal from Sil is a good move for you.

I assume England's been speaking with you as well, and just wanted to confirm the three of us are on the same page.

8,Nobody makes it far without friends in this game. I suppose you're hoping to be friends with France then?,True,1,0,england,germany,2,53
8,"I don't consider it wise to put stock in any friendship until it's proven. However, I tend to trust people more if they are willing to give me some information before asking it from me",True,1,0,germany,england,3,59
8,"Well, that makes two of us then. You're welcome to ask a specific question if you have one though.",True,1,0,england,germany,4,60
8,I'll be moving there this spring. Just doing a pretty standard northern opening. You taking the fleet to Holland or Denmark (or somewhere else)?,True,1,0,england,germany,6,79
8,My fleet is Holland-bound. Pleasure doing business üòÉ,True,1,0,germany,england,7,83
8,"Alright, thanks for letting me know. I'd also like to talk about me going to Belgium. I imagine this is something a bit less amenable to you, but maybe something we could bargain over?",True,1,0,england,germany,8,88
8,"Well, now the Belgium discussion changes a bit. France has this secured unless we collaborate in opposition. Also, I can prevent your move to Denmark.",True,1,0,england,germany,9,172
8,"So I could do this, but to secure the move you would also have to cut the support from Bur that France will likely give to move Pic to Bel. You can just attack Bur from Mun to do this. Also, providing this support is a bit of a favor and might put me at odds with France. Would you be willing to offer Denmark to sweeten the deal for me?",True,1,0,england,germany,11,174
8,how can you take Denmark while also supporting me from the north sea?,True,1,0,germany,england,12,177
8,"I'm sorry, but why? Why couldn't I hold it for this Winter and then dip in the Spring to let you in?",True,1,0,germany,england,14,189
8,"I'd sooner keep Denmark and let you be the one to occupy Belgium, if that's preferable (i.e. support your North sea fleet moving there)",True,1,0,germany,england,15,191
8,The reason is because I'd need your support into denmark to be sure russia couldn't bump me out. And it's putting a lot of trust in you to expect you'll just clear the way for me.,True,1,0,england,germany,16,197
8,"Well so what do you think of my counter offer, then?",True,1,0,germany,england,17,204
8,"I certainly appreciate it. The only issue is that it still doesn't guarantee Belgium for me. France may support Bur from Pic instead, and then it would be a bounce.",True,1,0,england,germany,18,205
8,"I have it on, admittedly, Italian authority that France is trying to make a play for Munich from Burgundy. But even if that weren't the case, vacating burgundy would leave Marseilles vulnerable to me. So I think the only option for France that wouldn't be Pyrrhic is to move from Pic",True,1,0,germany,england,19,206
8,"That's fair. At the least I'd like to keep France out of Belgium, even if I don't end up with it.",False,1,0,england,germany,20,207
8,Also I had to look up Pyrrhic haha,True,1,0,england,germany,21,208
8,"Yes, we have a deal.",True,1,0,england,germany,23,239
8,Your holland fleet supports Nth to Bel and I stay out of Denmark this turn.,True,1,0,england,germany,24,240
8,you have a healthy sense of distrust and I respect that. But I appreciate you not trying to keep me out of Denmark nonetheless.,True,1,1,germany,england,25,257
8,"Also, do you have thoughts on how we might collaborate next year? What are your goals, and what are your concerns?",True,1,-1,england,germany,26,276
8,You‚Äôre giving me too much credit. I forgot to click submit on my order for the north sea or something. Was surprised myself to see a hold there. So why did you back out of the deal then?,True,1,-1,england,germany,27,277
8,Preferred to see France there.,True,1,1,germany,england,28,279
8,"I can understand why you might have made that move, but I think it‚Äôs actually bad for both of us. Even if you and France team up to knock me out, france will get the better part of that deal and will then work with Russia to take you down.",True,1,-1,england,germany,29,281
8,"If I work with France, we‚Äôll bring Russia in on it (who needs some help after what happened with Turkey). This looks good for all three of us, and very bad for you.",True,1,-1,england,germany,30,282
8,"The last option is for us to work together against France. On the one hand, this is a good move because France is a strong player in a strong position. On the other hand, how am I supposed to trust you at all to cooperate?",True,1,-1,england,germany,31,283
8,"Real talk: I was given bad information that you and France were working together last round, which does not seem to be the case, but that's why I didn't follow through on our deal. I am well positioned now to take Belgium, and I can see now that, as you say, it would be much easier on me to ally with you rather than try to take you down even with France's help. But I can understand if you don't want to trust me.",True,1,1,germany,england,32,284
8,"I was working with France, and I still have a positive relationship with france. We agreed to stay out of the english channel, and france had agreed to support me into belgium. But this was about hedging my bets, not working against you. And you see how that played out haha.",True,1,-1,england,germany,33,285
8,France would love for me to be an ally in taking you out of the game over the next couple of years. They‚Äôve been talking about convincing russia to help with the takedown.,True,1,-1,england,germany,34,286
8,"A joint stab against france would require a high level of collaboration on our end. Something like an agreement to essentially act as one country up until a certain year. Sharing all planned moves, following up on them etc. So this would be my condition for working together.",True,1,-1,england,germany,35,295
8,"I would be willing to do that, but as I see it, you have no reason to choose France as an ally over me at this point. So, why me?",True,1,1,germany,england,36,303
8,*choose me as an ally over france,True,1,1,germany,england,37,306
8,"So my reasoning is that I think France is a stronger player than either of us, or at least a more engaged one. I'm getting all this tactical analysis and commentary about the state of the whole board and all that. If I help France, France probably beats me. If we defeat France together, I think we each end up with an even fighting chance.",True,1,-1,england,germany,38,310
8,So basically France is too smart to be left alive and the world ought to belong to us idiots üòÇ,True,1,1,germany,england,39,315
8,What about Russia?,True,1,1,germany,england,40,316
8,"Haha yeah that was kind of my thinking. Russia is a little tied up in the south, and so I don't expect aggression in the north. However, france would respond to a stab by begging for Russian (and potentially austrian and italian) assistance. So the choice next year is between containing russia or being aggressive (which would mean going for sweden or St. P). I think the builds we see this winter will make it more clear what's possible.",True,1,-1,england,germany,41,326
8,"Speaking of, what are your planned builds? I'm building a fleet in London.",True,1,-1,england,germany,42,330
8,Armies in Kiel and Munich,True,1,1,germany,england,43,333
8,What are your plans for your north sea and London fleets?  I'm trying to decide now how best to handle Belgium and that is going to depend on whether France is concerned with defending Brest or if instead they expect help from you in disrupting anything I try to do from Holland.   ...I can offer you support in moving into Sweden in exchange for supporting my Burgundy troops into Belgium? Is that worth more than whatever France might be offering you right now?,True,1,1,germany,england,44,343
8,Any thoughts on my offer? I have another proposal if you‚Äôre interested,True,1,1,germany,england,45,377
8,England. You're killin me here.,True,1,1,germany,england,46,381
8,Hey sorry. Busy evening for me. Let me think a second and respond to all this..,True,1,-1,england,germany,47,382
8,"Ok so for one thing France isn't exactly offering me anything, so there's no real comparison of your offer vs theirs.",True,1,-1,england,germany,48,384
8,"My once concern about the full-on france stab would be that the job couldn't be done quickly enough. We could force Bel this year, but we unfortunately wouldn't be able to put France down a unit because Spa is a guarantee for France. This may even allow for a rebuild in Bre if the Belgian army gets dislodged.",True,1,-1,england,germany,49,385
8,That's where my new plan comes in!,True,1,1,germany,england,50,386
8,Ok what's the sitch,True,1,-1,england,germany,51,387
8,"You move fleets to Eng, Ska, and Nth this turn. Italy moves to Pie. I move Hol-Bel, Kie-Ruh, Bur-Gas, Mun-Bur. Now, France might foresee me attempting to take Gas, but more likely they want to dislodge me from Bur. This puts them in a position where they will have to lose one of Paris, Belgium, Marseilles, or Brest, and will not be able to vacate the others for building season.",True,1,1,germany,england,52,391
8,France could stop by bumping Par and Mar in Gas right? And you're suggesting my moves a setup of going against russia?,True,1,-1,england,germany,53,394
8,"Also, have you talked to Italy about this?",True,1,-1,england,germany,54,397
8,"Damn--I didn't think of the bumping. (sorry, this is just my first game and I'm still learning). And yeah I thought you'd want to grab Sweden because why not?   I haven't discussed the full plan, but they seemed amenable to moving to pie",True,1,1,germany,england,55,398
8,Okay how about this:,True,1,1,germany,england,56,400
8,"Keep your fleets in NWG and NTH, but move to ENG. Have NTH support HOL-BEL.  I'll attack BUR-PIC, move KIE-RUH, MUN-BUR. If France does a Gascon Bounce, They'll have to lose either Brest or Paris or Marseilles. If they try to dislodge me instead, I'll retreat to Gascony.  You still get my support to march on Sweden in Fall if desired.",True,1,1,germany,england,57,403
8,Keep in mind that Munich is vulnerable. Italy and Austria may have a deal in the works for that. But this is the sort of plan that I had thought through originally.,True,1,-1,england,germany,58,404
8,This would be a break of my DMZ with France in the channel. Which is why the success of a stab like this is especially important.,True,1,-1,england,germany,59,405
8,"well ya could have saved me some brain cells by sharing it in the first place! üòõ   And Italy and Austria, unless they're lying, think of me as an ally. That said, my plan doesn't actually involve vacating Munich",True,1,1,germany,england,60,406
8,"Oh fair, because you're not actually moving into Pic, you're just cutting the support. I had you moving from Bur to Bel. Dislodging the French army from Bel could result in a disband. And if we don't get an additional supply center could mean a rebuild in Brest, which would be bad for me (adding Spain is probably a given). Have you considered the potential support of Mar from Spa s.c. ?",True,1,-1,england,germany,61,407
8,"Yeah if my calculations are correct the French home supply centers hold. First move is to bounce in Gas to keep you out, then move spain to s.c. and lose bel. Next move is to support hold in mar from spain s.c. and then bounce paris to brest to keep me out. Bre, Par, and Mar all hold in the fall.",True,1,-1,england,germany,62,408
8,"OK, Marseilles might be a no-go this round then.   If you don't want a rebuild in Brest, we'll simply attack Picardy and force a retreat to Brest by an army. Not so bad for your fleet, right? I'll move into Paris from BUR",True,1,1,germany,england,63,409
8,"wait I mean A retreat to burgundy by that army. Then the Parisian Army will be in brest, so no rebuild will occur",True,1,1,germany,england,64,410
8,"Well, it kind of becomes rock paper scissors there. If I try to go into Brest it's a bounce and it remains open. If I don't, and France takes the risk of not going (probably won't happen) then it would stay open too.",True,1,-1,england,germany,65,411
8,"Sounds like you'd like the belgian army to disband though. I understand, as it could help somebody out to take munich from Ruh.",True,1,-1,england,germany,66,412
8,"whoa dude I just want a supply center don't go talking about people invading the fatherland  So are you saying no deal, then?",True,1,1,germany,england,67,413
8,"No, I'm just echoing your probable reasoning for wanting the disband of the belgian army rather than its retreat to Ruh.",True,1,-1,england,germany,68,414
8,"I don't see what that has to do with you, though? Like what difference does it make to you whether that army disbands or retreats to Ruh?",True,1,1,germany,england,69,415
8,"The disband allows for a rebuild, if there's an open home supply center and France still has 5 total. So this could mean building a fleet in Brest.",True,1,-1,england,germany,70,416
8,ohhh I see. So what you're saying is you'd accept the deal if I didn't arrange for the disband and allowed a retreat to Ruh?,True,1,1,germany,england,71,417
8,"Let me sleep on it. I may be fine regardless. I'll confirm moves in the morning. But for this plan, Spring looks like your support into Sweden and my support into Belgium. I'll be very curious to see moves from Russia-Italy-Austria. If they all converge in on you, this could be trouble. I doubt that level of collaboration is going to happen though.",True,1,-1,england,germany,72,418
8,hang on would you be willing to postpone your sweden march until Fall? I'm not so keen on forcing Russia into the baltic,True,1,1,germany,england,73,419
8,You'd still hold sweden by winter,True,1,1,germany,england,74,420
8,Yeah that would be fair. Just need to run it by russia that norway is a hold in the spring so that doesn‚Äôt raise any eyebrows,True,1,-1,england,germany,75,421
8,"Well, or you could march into Finland just to spice things up",True,1,1,germany,england,76,422
8,Well England you've taught me an important lesson,True,1,1,germany,england,77,485
8,"This isn‚Äôt a full stab. I‚Äôm sorry for the deception though. I hadn‚Äôt heard whether Italy was anti-French. Now I have. I‚Äôm taking Denmark this year with Russian support. I‚Äôm sorry for that too. Kiel can‚Äôt save it. I‚Äôd suggest you bounce kiel and munich in Ruh and then attack holland from belgium to cut support . This will hold the line (unless france decides to let you into belgium, which would be unlikely).",True,1,-1,england,germany,78,535
8,"I know you don‚Äôt want to take advice from me, but you‚Äôre kind of in survival mode now. We can talk about belgium for you next year to get you back on your feet.",True,1,-1,england,germany,79,536
8,"England, I have 0.0 reason to trust your advice regarding France. You're so clearly working with them!",True,1,1,germany,england,80,547
8,"I think the tactical suggestion stands on its own though. You can work through the rules to verify it makes sense (and should, in case i‚Äôm making a mistake). Also I don‚Äôt know france‚Äôs moves this season. And you should ping italy to talk about me.",True,1,-1,england,germany,81,549
8,Nice! I guess you knew what you were doing.,True,1,1,england,germany,82,550
8,well not really--I just assumed that attacking a convoying fleet would disrupt the convoy and that was apparently wrong,True,1,-1,germany,england,83,551
8,Yeah you have to dislodge. But you held ruhr! And my way wouldn‚Äôt have worked actually. That‚Äôs a stalemate line if you do the same moves except the fleet goes to belgium (i think). Can only be broken if i support it. Of course france could choose to let you in to ruhr as well,True,1,1,england,germany,84,552
8,"Hi, not sure what you heard from italy. Looking forward to the three of us working against france though. Let me know where you‚Äôre at with this. I‚Äôd help you into belgium this year.",True,1,1,england,germany,85,621
8,"Okay, I‚Äôm down to cooperate.",True,1,-1,germany,england,86,622
8,Hi. I‚Äôm guessing the move to HEL was to cut support. Should have let you know I was moving out. Are you still interested in collaboration for survival? We‚Äôre both a bit threatened right now.,True,1,1,england,germany,88,688
8,"Hi‚Äîyeah, because of bot troubles I never got reassured last turn that you wouldn‚Äôt support, say, France into belgium or something. So now here we are! France asked me to bump Nth to cut your channel support, just fyi",True,1,-1,germany,england,89,695
8,To be clear I don‚Äôt intend to do that since I basically need everyone to fall back to keep my holdings this turn. Do you have any clue what russia‚Äôs plans are?,True,1,-1,germany,england,90,696
8,"Not sure what russia will do, but I‚Äôd be a little concerned about berlin being surrounded. I won‚Äôt be attacking Kiel so your support will go through from there.",True,1,1,england,germany,91,726

8,I told France (truthfully) that I couldn't cut your support this turn,True,1,-1,germany,england,93,742
8,Cool. Do you need me to cut support in BAL or do you have that covered with Munich support?,True,1,1,england,germany,94,746
8,"Also, Italy is on board with a stab against France.",True,1,1,england,germany,95,747
8,"Italy told me that, too. And actually, if I could count on you to cut BAL support, it would free up Kiel to try and defend Ruhr from france for a turn. However, if you're using that denmark fleet for something else just let me know",True,1,-1,germany,england,96,749
8,So I have kind of a crazy idea. I'm curious what you'd think of this.,True,1,1,england,germany,97,750
8,What if I let you into Denmark and I go for Sweden?,True,1,1,england,germany,98,751
8,"Well, if France goes for Holland I'd be in a slightly strategically worse position.",True,1,-1,germany,england,99,752
8,I was thinking you'd go from Kiel and bounce Holland with the HEL fleet. Then you get your build in Kiel,True,1,1,england,germany,100,753
8,"that wouldn't work because I need kiel to support berlin, i think?",True,1,-1,germany,england,101,754
8,Is Munich occupied doing something else? Italy told me he has no plans of cutting support there.,True,1,1,england,germany,102,755
8,Oh I guess Bur can do that though...,True,1,1,england,germany,103,756
8,that was my fear...,True,1,-1,germany,england,104,757

8,"But without action, Russia probably takes Ank this fall and builds in Stp.",True,1,1,england,germany,106,759
8,Is it worth losing the channel this turn? because you could take sweden for sure if you were willing to use nth to convoy,True,1,-1,germany,england,107,760
8,Nth can't convoy to Sweden. SKA is in the way.,True,1,1,england,germany,108,761
8,doesn't need to. just convoy to norway and move your fleet from norway to sweden. then attack the baltic fleet from denmark. that way you don't lose norway,True,1,-1,germany,england,109,762
8,BAL could move to sweden to bounce. only way to guarantee would be to support from Denmark,True,1,1,england,germany,110,763
8,"ah crap you're right. sorry, wish I could help but all I have are land troops",True,1,-1,germany,england,111,764
8,"No worries. I'll give it a shot regardless. And if I do get the extra build, I can provide some serious support to your moves west",True,1,1,england,germany,112,765

8,go team!,True,1,1,england,germany,115,769
8,you held the channel! but no sweden yet...,True,1,-1,germany,england,116,771
8,Yeah. I think the bounce there will be a start of negotiations with Russia. Clearly we were both on the same page.,True,1,1,england,germany,117,772
8,And you got holland back!,True,1,1,england,germany,118,773
8,ach but now there's French in ruhr that'll be a pain,True,1,-1,germany,england,119,775
8,"A bit. France starts to crumble when I don't have to support my fleet anymore, which is when Italy forces France to go south with its MAO fleet. Then I can start supporting your moves and we can get you into belgium, etc.",True,1,1,england,germany,120,786
8,Are you gonna try for sweden again this season? France told me that they're not moving their Mid-Atlantic fleet and instead would prefer to oust you from the channel.   Italy gave me the idea of supporting your Welsh troops to convoy into Belgium. But if I did would you mind giving it to me in the Fall? I could be way more useful to you if I could build another unit this winter,True,1,-1,germany,england,121,828

8,"I'm happy to give you belgium. My idea of the split is you get Bel and Par, I get Bre and Por, and Italy gets Mar and Spa. Obviously this won't all happen this year. But you in Bel makes sense long-term",True,1,1,england,germany,124,836
8,"The convoy makes me a bit nervous because if France goes to IRI, they'll get a home supply center in the fall.",True,1,1,england,germany,125,837
8,"Okay, no convoy then.   How do you feel about reneging with Russia? If you moved into the baltic instead of bouncing and I moved into Denmark (this is also insurance in case I can't end up with Belgium this year), I could support you into sweden in the fall?",True,1,-1,germany,england,126,838
8,"I'd prefer to keep neutral with russia, as fighting a war on two fronts would be a lot for me. Belgium isn't guaranteed for you this year, but I think it's likely. France will have to respect the pressure in the south from Italy. This frees me up to cut support in Pic and support you in from Nth. Then you just have to cut support in Ruh and Bur (if there's still something there in the fall).",True,1,1,england,germany,127,840
8,"If France is honest with me, Ruhr will be free and Bur will be occupied.   Let's be real here, though: Russia has at most two units to spare to threaten you, and likely not even that given the imminent pressure from Austria. I'm trying to work it out in the sandbox now but I really don't think they'd be an issue for you...",True,1,-1,germany,england,128,842
8,"Russia can support into Norway once he's in Sweden, and NTH won't be free to stop that.",True,1,1,england,germany,129,845
8,"Okay that checks out. Thanks for your patience!  ...I was thinking of asking russia to support me into denmark this turn and offer to support them into sweden next season. I'm doing this a) to confirm for you that they're on board with the bump as you say, and b) to show that I'd like to work to build trust with them. However, if Russia already knows you and I are working together this will establish the opposite of trust. So I guess I'm asking if you think this is a good/useful idea, and also asking what russia knows about our plans?",True,1,-1,germany,england,130,846
8,Russia can only suspect that we're working together at this point. I haven't given any indication of collaboration. I'd say ask away.,True,1,1,england,germany,131,847
8,Are you definitely committed to not cutting support in Nth?,True,1,1,england,germany,132,849
8,"I really, really am. Maybe I'm just not creative enough, but because of my alliance with Italy, who is in turn strongly allied with Austria, I just don't see myself ever getting anywhere in this game unless I can expand westward into France. Hence, even though you're honestly scarier right now I'm inclined to be on your side for the foreseeable future.  Now, you could just go copy-paste this message to France and I'd be royally screwed, so I hope that helps you believe you can trust me.",True,1,-1,germany,england,133,850
8,"Haha ok, glad to get the confirmation. On my end i‚Äôll confirm I am totally anti-french until France is out of the game. I‚Äôve actually ceased communications with France (maybe something we can all do once the stab is clear). I‚Äôd like all three of us to get our two builds each together. Then we can look east.",True,1,1,england,germany,134,854

8,We‚Äôre in a great spot. Belgium for you is a guarantee. Planning to take from holland or ruhr?,False,1,1,england,germany,136,911
8,Why do you ask? I assumed you were going to disrupt support from Picardy with a convoyed army while I disrupted Burgundy? That way you can still use Nth to support the channel in case France decides not to bother defending in the south,True,1,-1,germany,england,137,914
8,"I‚Äôm a little worried that a clever france may let me into Pic, knowing that belgium is gone, and then move into IRI for invasion. I‚Äôd almost rather cut Pic with the channel and risk losing the channel. And my favorite option is to support ruh to bel from nth, also risking the channel. The logic is that if I lose the channel, it won‚Äôt be for very long, but if I lose a home supply center, that will be very annoying. France seems pretty upset with me, so a kamikaze move to screw me over isn‚Äôt out of the question.",True,1,1,england,germany,138,915
8,"Yeah, I'm getting that vibe from France too. Let's go with moving me from Ruhr",True,1,-1,germany,england,139,918
8,"Sounds good. Consistent with that theory, we‚Äôd advise italy to support into Spain instead of Mar. It‚Äôs a tough call though",True,1,1,england,germany,140,920
8,"I mean, not really. The way Italy's positioned it seems like Spain is the only right call and that Marseilles will fall like a domino on a fault line next spring?  ...unless we could confirm that France really doesn't intend to defend. Then Italy could potentially swipe both in one swoop. But even if France is saying such things to me (and they are) it's still a risk",True,1,-1,germany,england,141,921
8,"Marseilles isn't guaranteed to fall next spring. Suppose Italy supports into Spa. France can block that supporting MAO from Gas. Suppose in the spring, Italy changes course and goes for Mar. France can then support Bur to Mar from Gas. Unless I'm missing something, it's a guessing game until you're in Bur.",True,1,1,england,germany,142,930
8,"God dammit. Just when I think I get this game, I‚Äôm still not clear on how the ‚Äòcoast‚Äô thing works with fleets",True,1,-1,germany,england,143,931
8,Do you think I could trust Russia not to try to swipe Munich if I tried to take Bur this turn?,True,1,-1,germany,england,144,932
8,"Yeah the territory can only be occupied by one unit regardless of coast. But a fleet must go to either the north or south coast. MAO can go to both. The coast matters if say you want to go from Spain to Mar. You can go there from the south coast, but not the north coast. And if you wanted to do this, you could coordinate a bounce with the Ber and Tyr armies so Russia can't sneak in. You're planning to sneak into Mun unsupported?",True,1,1,england,germany,145,933
8,sneak into Bur*,True,1,1,england,germany,146,934
8,"well, at least to try for it. i hadnt thought of bumping with italy because i assumed tyr would move into pie",True,1,-1,germany,england,147,935
8,"Well your move only works if we let Bur into Mar, which means Italy doesn't try for Mar, which means pie would hold.",True,1,1,england,germany,148,936
8,"oh i thought italy was trying for spa? or rather, wherever italy decides to go there's a chance it might work, and then they'd want someone in pie",True,1,-1,germany,england,149,937
8,"We'll have to see which move Italy wants to make. If Italy goes for Spa, the choice is between a hold or an attack from Pie. I would say a hold makes most sense for Italy if you've decided you're going for Bur. This is because the alternative may be a bounce with Bur and Pie armies in Mar that would foil your plan to get to Bur and wouldn't give Italy anything.",True,1,1,england,germany,150,938
8,Okay that makes sense then.,True,1,-1,germany,england,151,939
8,As long as Italy doesn't want to try to convoy into Spain from Pie. Then Marseilles could be left open *and* tyrolia could potentially move into piedmont,True,1,-1,germany,england,152,940
8,"Yeah that could be an idea. Well, let me know when you hear from Italy. The good news is France will definitely be down one this year and maybe down two. And our progress will continue next year. At some point we should talk about post-war things.",True,1,1,england,germany,153,941
8,Does post-war things mean how we're going to deal with a seriously overpowered Austria/Italy?,True,1,-1,germany,england,154,960
8,"Yeah. Though the move into Trieste by Italy is interesting. I'm actually starting to worry about collaboration with France. Would Italy really be so greedy as to start a war on two fronts? Also, had you asked for a hold in Pie? (not that it would have changed the outcome)",True,1,0,england,germany,155,1025
8,"I asked but Italy told me that they couldn‚Äôt guarantee they would or wouldn‚Äôt, and I can understand wanting to keep that info need-to-know.

We can half-heartedly attack Pic this spring if you want (I'll move Bel-Pic, you support), though I doubt we'll get anywhere with it Munich will support Kie-Ruh And Fall I'll do a three-sided assault on Bur.

And speaking of fleet things: if you're not doing anything with Nth this turn anyway, could you help me out by supporting Hol-Bel?

I haven't heard back from France yet, but I am sort of playing double-agent with Italy to ensure that France can continue countering Italy's Spa/Mar plays and it just looks like luck. This keeps Italy in check until you and I make progress in the north and are better positioned to push Italy back.  I should have mentioned, but a third reason for the fleet build last turn was to keep France's trust.

8,Was that the reasoning you gave for not supporting?,True,1,0,germany,england,200,1149

If italy agrees, let me know. I'll tell France to put all power into defending Marseilles and Mao.

8,Honestly because I thought you‚Äôd say yes to giving me Denmark. I doubt we‚Äôve run into each other because I‚Äôm in St Louis for the summer,True,1,0,germany,england,221,1257
8,"Yeah, we should have talked about that  before probably. On its own, the move has a somewhat anti-me connotation. And yeah I definitely have not been to St Louis this summer haha",True,1,0,england,germany,222,1258
8,"Sorry to spook you! And not to beat a dead horse, but: you claim you want to secure another build, but with your denmark fleet basically stuck where it is, it‚Äôs not like keeping it is going to help you with that goal. That supply center‚Äôs doing nothing for you except maintaining the unit bound to it. *I* on the other hand, could help you get what you want by getting another build.  If you have plans to use the denmark fleet, I‚Äôll respect them, because right now our goals are the same. But I see no point in keeping the fleet just for its own sake.  Yep, going for Bur",True,1,0,germany,england,224,1264
8,Yeah I mean it's a bargaining chip. Russia has to be in my good graces while I have it. And it's something I could offer you in exchange for something nice. It's not clear to me why you need it right now. Paris has your name on it. You'll win the eventual for Mar with no trouble.,True,1,0,england,germany,225,1265
8,"Alright, that‚Äôs a valid reason. I was feeling more urgent about it because I think it‚Äôs paramount that Russia get some aid against Austria.",True,1,0,germany,england,226,1268
8,"Yeah that's fair. I think Russia is clever enough to re-instate the stalemate, though. Maybe I'll drop him a line to see what he's thinking.",True,1,0,england,germany,227,1273
8,BTW italy plans to literally randomize his move choice.,True,1,0,england,germany,228,1293
8,Thanks for letting me know!,True,1,0,germany,england,229,1343
8,Nice job on Bur. Let's see if we can get you paris next year!,True,1,0,england,germany,230,1352
8,What's your plan for taking MAO? If you want to move Eng-IRI I will support Nth into the Channel?,True,1,0,germany,england,231,1390
8,"Yeah i was thinking the same actually. Only risk is a bump in IRI i think results in dislodge of the current channel unit. I‚Äôm willing to risk it though. France at this point is likely trying to choose who to annoy the most as he goes down. I have a feeling it will be me, even though i‚Äôm not the one taking his territories so far. I‚Äôll probably go another year without a build unfortunately",True,1,0,england,germany,232,1396
8,"Patience, my tea-sipping friend üòõ  But if you dislodge trying to get IRI that means you at least got Nao, and putting the unit in Pic would help you take Brest anyway",True,1,0,germany,england,233,1397
8,Oh i‚Äôm planning nwg to nth so that i‚Äôm still in nth. Do you think the brest fleet may move to Pic?,True,1,0,england,germany,234,1398
8,"ya know, if you'd just let me have Denmark back you could keep Nth *and* get at least one of Nao/Iri/Brest this year. I can keep talking to France to see where their head's at, but I think a move to Pic is probably not in the cards. If you were to predict it France'd lose Brest!",True,1,0,germany,england,235,1399
8,Are you still on good terms with France? Was the move into Bur expected?,True,1,0,england,germany,236,1400
8,"It was, actually. France has seen the end coming for a while, but since I was willing to work with them against Italy while you two ghosted, they're more amenable to my invasion that yours or Italy's.",True,1,0,germany,england,237,1401
8,"Makes sense. Well, let me think about whether Denmark is a possibility (though I‚Äôm still very hesitant) and get back to you. And I let me know what France is up to with Brest.",True,1,0,england,germany,238,1406
8,"Alternatively, why not just leave Nth empty for a turn?  I'm working on figuring out France as we speak...",True,1,0,germany,england,239,1407
8,"Cool. And I suppose I could, though it does leave me a little vulnerable. Maybe we could talk a bit about what our collaboration looks like over the next couple of years",True,1,0,england,germany,240,1410
8,"Well, I can say definitively at this point that France prefers to mess with Italy over you. Basically they don't want to see Italy totally dominate this game. I encouraged this by saying that Italy's going to try for MAO this turn and they should focus on defending that.   Wrt the next couple years, my idea is this: it's crucial that you take Mao, and that I take Paris. From here, you and I can work on beating Italy out of the Iberian, such that you end up with Portugal, Marseilles, and Spain and I end up with Brest and Paris (though you can have Brest at first). From here we're well positioned to start hitting Italy on their home turf, esp. if Russia can keep hammering away at Austria",False,1,0,germany,england,241,1411
8,...any thoughts on this?,True,1,0,germany,england,242,1424
8,That all makes sense. Thought I'm a bit surprised that you'd rather have Brest than Mar. What's the reasoning for that preference? And how long would you let me hold onto Brest?,True,1,0,england,germany,243,1431
8,"I figured this split would give you land and sea options for attacking italy and not for attacking me. But I was just spitballing, and it may make more sense to divide it your way...And you could hold Brest until we were the only two in all of France and Spain, I suppose",True,1,0,germany,england,244,1432
8,have you made a decision yet about what to do about Nth?,True,1,0,germany,england,245,1433
8,I prefer to do the same moves as last time. So Nth would be a hold. I don't think MAO is going to IRI or NAO. But you would have the inside scoop.,True,1,0,england,germany,246,1437
8,What would you do with Bel if it was freed up?,True,1,0,england,germany,247,1439
8,"Wait when you say Nth is a hold, do you mean you *don't* want to try for IRI like we talked about, and you're just holding the channel?",True,1,0,germany,england,248,1441
8,"That‚Äôs what i‚Äôm thinking now, yes",True,1,0,england,germany,249,1442
8,"*just holding the channel and convoying to Brest?  And if by ""it"" in ""what would you do with Bel if it was freed up?"", you mean Nth, then probably move it to Pic in case France tries to bounce me out of Paris. But it might make more sense for you to just convoy to Pic, in which case Bel could support you into Pic",True,1,0,germany,england,250,1444
8,"oh nevermind you mean ""what would you do with Bel if Bel wasn't supporting Nth""? Well, my answer still applies",True,1,0,germany,england,251,1445
8,...Would you like me to support your army into Pic?,True,1,0,germany,england,252,1448
8,That army isn‚Äôt leaving the island until france‚Äôs fate is sealed. Otherwise I open up my home centers to France.,True,1,0,england,germany,253,1449
8,but you did convoy to brest last time? Was that just because you were sure the army would bounce?   So then basically everyone's holding still except you're poking Nao?,True,1,0,germany,england,254,1450
8,"Yeah that‚Äôs my plan. The convoy was because if it worked, I could just build on the island and be fine. But i‚Äôm taking on a risk if i can‚Äôt guarantee the build.",True,1,0,england,germany,255,1451
8,"ohh gotcha. I'm moving Bur-Par, Ruh-Bur. Everyone else is just staying put",False,1,0,germany,england,256,1452
8,I really am curious about your relationship with France btw. Italy mentioned that you asked him recently whether collaboration with France was ok. But what could that mean unless it was against me?,True,1,0,england,germany,257,1453
8,"üôÑ Italy said that you were plotting against me, too! They're just trying to make us suspicious of each other!",True,0,0,germany,england,258,1454
8,So you‚Äôre saying italy lied to me? I‚Äôm gonna make you click that thumbs down if you‚Äôre trying to fool me here.,True,1,0,england,germany,259,1455
8,"Well, no. It's true that I asked Italy about collaborating with France, but only because France wanted us all to be able to talk about its last will and testament together. I didn't bother asking you because you had been pretty clear on ghosting France, but I wasn't sure whether Italy was or not til I asked",True,0,0,germany,england,260,1457
8,But it's very possible that Italy took this fact and warped it to make you suspicious of me,True,1,0,germany,england,261,1458
8,"So, while we're at it, is there anything you might have said to Italy to indicate you were planning to turn on me?",True,1,0,germany,england,262,1459
8,Well i‚Äôm glad i asked the follow up question. Did italy agree to being part of this discussion? And how did the discussion turn out. Is France going to take out his anger on me with a final stab? Are you going to help him? And yeah i‚Äôve absolutely been talking up anti-german things to italy. I want him to be confident in where i stand so he doesn‚Äôt expect a stab.,True,1,0,england,germany,263,1460
8,"Oh italy said ""I don't trust France"" and that was the end of it. So no, there didn't end up being a discussion except me telling France that you're gunning for Brest (which was obvious anyway), and that Italy's shooting for Mao this turn (which may or may not be true--but by this time you and I were strategizing and I wanted to keep France out of our way).  If france *is* planning to stab you, they're intentionally throwing me off the scent. Which would be surprising but not unheard of. So no, I'm not planning to help in a stab I know nothing about.",True,0,0,germany,england,264,1461
8,"Well, to be clear, another consequence of my and France's conversation was that France is just letting me walk into Paris this turn (unless they're gonna stab me but I doubt it)",True,1,0,germany,england,265,1462
8,"Yeah i believe that. So i guess it‚Äôs just giving italy a hard time then, or maybe some unexpected movement north. Has italy talked to you about attacking me?",True,1,0,england,germany,266,1463
8,Post-france?,True,1,0,england,germany,267,1464
8,Well yeah. In the same convo where they said you were plotting to stab me they gave some reasons why it's better for me to side with them than with you. So no specifics but Italy clearly wants us against each other. But I don't think either of us stand a chance if we fall for that.,True,1,0,germany,england,268,1465
8,"*no specific attacks were suggested, I mean",True,1,0,germany,england,269,1466
8,"Gotcha. Well i think we have to acknowledge that our alliance would be sort of geographically awkward. I think that makes the alliance stronger actually, but we should be honest with each other about an exit that gives each of us a fair shot in the endgame.",True,1,0,england,germany,270,1467
8,"okay...well, as the person who has ever seen an endgame before, what do *you* suggest?",True,1,0,germany,england,271,1468
8,"I think we agree to coordinated actions until italy is dealt with. I think you in brest is actually more fair, although less ideal for me. I think we need to pick a victor of the russian-austrian war. Austria is an easier pick because i can take russian dots and austria can help with italy.",True,1,0,england,germany,272,1469
8,"Alright. But it will be harder to flip Austria against Italy, I think.",True,1,0,germany,england,273,1470
8,"Nah, i‚Äôve been working on it a bit, and it‚Äôs only natural once his current conflict is mitigated somewhat",True,1,0,england,germany,274,1471
8,I think between us we should find a split of dots we feel comfortable with. Not that it can‚Äôt change in future negotiations. But i think it‚Äôs easier to stay friends when the end seems fair from the get-go,True,1,0,england,germany,275,1472
8,"We don‚Äôt have to do this tonight, but soon.",True,1,0,england,germany,276,1473
8,"Okay, soon. Glad we had this talk üòÉ",True,1,0,germany,england,277,1474
8,"Fwiw i‚Äôm a relative first-timer too. I‚Äôve played two or three times in person, and the first time we didn‚Äôt finish. I think everyone else plays a lot more. Would be nice to make this an underdog story.",True,1,0,england,germany,278,1476
8,Regardless of which way it falls in the end.,True,1,0,england,germany,279,1477
8,"I think so, too. And Italy is like the over-est of dogs.",True,1,0,germany,england,280,1479
8,You lost me haha. The over-est of dogs?,True,1,0,england,germany,281,1480
8,"like, the opposite of underdog would be overdog. And Italy is the most over-est overdog there is.",True,1,0,germany,england,282,1481
8,Haha gotcha. Do we think he‚Äôs actually the number 1 guy like france said? He denied it to me. But the username lines up.,True,1,0,england,germany,284,1483
8,"I think it's more probable than not. Although, I also think it's really unfair to have that information leaked when other players get the benefit of a clean slate. That said, just looking at the way Italy moves and talks it's clear that they know what they're doing",True,1,0,germany,england,285,1484
8,Yeah he‚Äôs definitely a good player. All the better when we take him down.,True,1,0,england,germany,286,1485
8,"I had been using ‚Äúthey‚Äù, but then i stopped once i saw other people using gendered pronouns. My rationalization was that the other players must have been confident in their correctness to start using them, but obviously that‚Äôs not true. We use ‚Äúshe‚Äù for you. France said it to me first i think. Happy to commit to being gender neutral in future negotiations (with all players)",True,1,0,england,germany,288,1491
8,"I didn‚Äôt mean to be directive‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt matter that much to me, but it makes me feel better if I know people aren‚Äôt just doing it mindlessly, and are actually matching it to players they know. I never specified to France that I use ‚Äúshe‚Äù but my username is feminine so it was a fair assumption.",True,1,0,germany,england,289,1493
8,Yeah that‚Äôs totally fair. I will admit I had floated the idea of trying to play feminine and flirt with one of the probably straight male players to gain favor. The username‚Äôs a giveaway though. And that might be taking things too far haha.,True,1,0,england,germany,290,1494
8,"That can‚Äôt possibly actually work, can it? The flirting, I mean. This is a serious game for serious-minded individuals üòõ",True,1,0,germany,england,291,1495
8,"...‚Äù, she writes, before adding a playful emoji at the end.",True,1,0,england,germany,292,1496
8,"All‚Äôs fair in love, war, and diplomacy üòâ",True,1,0,england,germany,293,1497
8,"Ouch! Still open to collaboration, but we‚Äôve got some trust building to do",True,1,0,england,germany,294,1506
8,"I wasn't sensing any trust from you, either: you were unwilling to return Denmark or to leave Nth empty, and you're right about our alliance being geographically awkward.   I want to be a good ally with you, but the difference between you and me is that you get a cozy corner of the map and I'm right in the middle. I need to be able to grow my army to defend all my various borders. So I'm asking for Denmark a little less politely.",True,1,0,germany,england,295,1567
8,"Well now you've seen me make exactly the moves that I said I would, so hopefully you have some trust in me. I see what you mean about the cozy corner, but coziness has its disadvantages as well. Once somebody gets on the island, it's a really bad time. And I need fleets or convoys of armies to get anywhere off the island. Makes expansion difficult.",True,1,0,england,germany,296,1568
8,"As far as denmark, the aggression there is fair. But you understand why I'm hesitant to drop down to 4 dots at this point in the game. Fortunately, there's an opportunity to do business here now that you're adjacent to Brest.",True,1,0,england,germany,297,1570
8,I'm definitely a bit upset about the support into the channel you gave and all of the lying. You didn't need to lie about your moves to amp up the aggression on denmark: I never asked for a full list of moves.,True,1,0,england,germany,298,1571
8,"That's true, I was overcompensating because it really seemed like your trust in me was low.",True,1,0,germany,england,299,1572
8,"Well, it's a vicious cycle. Mistrust breeds mistrust. So how can I trust now that you're not just going to continue working with France on an invasion?",True,1,0,england,germany,300,1574
8,"Because France is literally about to not exist, for one. And for another, because Italy is planning something that will be bad for both of us.",True,1,0,germany,england,301,1577
8,Planning something specific that you know about?,True,1,0,england,germany,302,1584
8,"Yes. But I was told specifically not to tell you so I need you to not mention it to any other players. I know that's a hard sell coming from me, but I need you to promise.",True,1,0,germany,england,303,1585
8,Alright. It‚Äôs a promise. Who‚Äôs the info from?,True,1,0,england,germany,304,1586
8,"Doubly confirmed by France and Italy. They've reached an agreement to give Italy the channel. When I confronted Italy about it, Italy said they wouldn't do it if I didn't want them to, but also admitted that they wouldn't have told me about it if I hadn't asked.",True,1,0,germany,england,305,1589
8,"But France also told me they would reneg on Italy if I asked. So, on the one hand, I could tell italy to call it off and things could proceed some unknown way. On the other, I could get France to reneg, and the three of us could turn this to our advantage. What do you think?",True,1,0,germany,england,306,1590
8,It‚Äôs certainly possible this is true. Though italy had told me he was actively deceiving France into getting the brest unit to do something unusual,True,1,0,england,germany,307,1593
8,"So if Italy is truly going for the channel, he went so far as to cover his tracks by warning me he may have suggested something like this to France",True,1,0,england,germany,308,1594
8,To what extent has italy communicated plans of an alliance with you?,True,1,0,england,germany,309,1595
8,"I mean that doesn't seem out of the question for Italy. Italy has told me point blank that if it's a choice between you or me, they'd choose me. I'm sure they've said the same to you.",True,1,0,germany,england,310,1596
8,Did he give any reasoning for that choice?,True,1,0,england,germany,311,1597
8,"Some bull about how I'm an honest communicator. That raised a red flag for me because Italy's too smart to need honesty from me. You're the better strategic choice.   So, it's entirely possible that Italy fed me this plot through France as some kind of ploy. And even that the two of you are already working closely together to ruin me, although I do hope that's not the case.",True,1,0,germany,england,312,1599
8,"I agree with all that. I‚Äôm just trying to tease out who he‚Äôs lying to, as that may provide some advantage. Honestly he‚Äôs been more pro-English than anti-German in his communications with me. I think he maybe just doesn‚Äôt want me to go tattle to you though.",True,1,0,england,germany,313,1601
8,So what moves would you want to see from me this fall?,True,1,0,england,germany,314,1602
8,"I'll tell Italy the deal is off, then you move Den-Nth, Nth-Eng (supported by Bel), Eng-Bre (supported by Paris). Mao will take Portugal and you'll take Mao? I know you'll have to trust my support in two places, but it's worth it to me to get two builds this turn  without a fuss and keep Italy localized to the south.",True,1,0,germany,england,315,1609
8,Did italy tell you MAO would take Portugal?,True,1,0,england,germany,316,1611
8,No. I haven't given them my opinion on the channel deal yet. But that would be what I'd suggest they do instead,False,1,0,germany,england,317,1612

8,"I just sent Italy a message about it, so I'll see what they say.",True,0,0,germany,england,319,1615
8,"What has Italy been saying to you lately, by the way?",True,1,0,germany,england,320,1616
8,He suggested some defensive tactics to me.,True,1,0,england,germany,321,1617
8,Defensives against me? in Denmark? Or France in Iri? Or both?,True,1,0,germany,england,322,1618
8,Both. He‚Äôs under the impression that we are not friendly after those last moves. I don‚Äôt plan to take his suggestion though,True,1,0,england,germany,323,1621
8,"I'm wondering if these defenses involve you not supporting Eng, which would kind of half-confirm the plot.",True,1,0,germany,england,324,1622
8,They do involve me not supporting Eng.,True,1,0,england,germany,325,1623
8,"Italy said they are busy this weekend (hard for me to imagine people having a life, but it must be so) and won't get back to me til monday.",True,1,0,germany,england,326,1627
8,"Gotcha. I‚Äôm playin dnd this weekend, but i‚Äôm not sure that quite counts as having a life). I‚Äôll probably be mostly offline through sunday evening just cause i really need a break from this game",True,1,0,england,germany,327,1628
8,"Umm the plan doesn't work btw. Gas is just going to cut the Par support that you promised me (this is the only useful thing it can do). So, no deal, unfortunately. I'll see if I can get last minute support in from Italy and let you know.",True,1,0,england,germany,328,1637
8,"I really don't think an attack from Gascony would be an issue, but I understand that your trust in France is much lower than mine. We could still work together somehow, though?",False,1,0,germany,england,329,1648
8,"In a tactical sense, anything else from Gascony would be a misfire. So not cutting the Paris support is just giving up Brest. I really don't think France is just going to hand Brest to me. I'm still waiting to see if I can get Italian support, in which case we're back in business. The alternative would be a more defensive move on my part (i really don't want to go down to 4 dots at this phase in the game).",True,1,0,england,germany,330,1649
8,Ok. Hope you'll see this before noon. Italy has agreed to support into Bre. I also require Par support for this to go through. Do you agree to provide Par supports channel to Bre and Bel supports Nth to Channel? I will vacate Denmark if so,True,1,0,england,germany,331,1681
8,"Ok, well if I don't hear from you in the next couple of minutes, I won't assume the support and will play defensive.",True,1,0,england,germany,332,1698
8,Sorry I'm trying to get verification from Italy but they're not responding. That's a good default plan,True,1,0,germany,england,333,1701

8,Yay!,True,1,-2,england,germany,341,1728
8,wow an 11th-hour three-power deal (with a decieved france as a fourth) that actually went through as planned!,True,1,2,germany,england,342,1731
8,"Yeah. And although we had our hiccups, this was really about as good as we could have hoped the takedown to be from the beginning.",True,1,-2,england,germany,343,1733
8,do you think there's a chance Italy would give you Mao willingly this turn?,True,1,2,germany,england,344,1764
8,There's a chance. I'm surprised by the fleet build btw.,True,1,-2,england,germany,345,1792
8,"My plan is to eventually have only fleets along my northwest coast (they're more versatile in that context) and move the armies inland.   See what you can negotiate with Italy, but no matter what they say, I'd be prepared to use your full strength to get Nao into Mao, if that's what you want to do.

8,"France and Italy are probably not working together after last year's stab. But France has asked me if there's anything I want Pic to help with. So depending on your plans I *may* be able to push some help your way. I feel like Italy's 10 units kind of speak for themselves, so even though you and F have had your differences there's a good chance F will want to help you/us as the underdogs",True,0,2,germany,england,350,1800
8,"Yeah I mean this turn I don't know what Pic does to help me. Anti-Italian moves are MAO as you've described. What are your thoughts on supporting Bre to Gas from Par? This would require a lot of trust from you, but would make supporting into Spa possible in the fall.",True,1,-2,england,germany,351,1855
8,Does that mean you'd convoy into Bre? Because I can ask France to support that!,True,1,2,germany,england,352,1869

My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial England seeking your advice, it would be so easy to just feed England enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island.   I know this from experience: back when you were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time-buying measure, since France was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over.

8,"Hi England, I know that the last thing I said to you was that a partnership between us wouldn't work out, but I've had a genuine change of heart. The reason for that is that I think Italy is far more duplicitous than any of us ever realized; right now they may be promising you that you'll take centers of mine, and maybe even that you two will share a victory together. This is my guess because these are the promises they made to me not so long ago. But we both need to face facts: Italy has never hesitated to profit from discord between us, and will always aid the weaker of us at the expense of the stronger.  If you're tired of being manipulated in a game Italy feels they own, I have a proposal that might get us both destroyed, but at least we'll have stuck up for ourselves and perhaps minorly inconvenienced Italy on their path to victory. This proposal involves France, who is more than willing to use their last few turns to fight back against Italy. Trusting them may be a hard sell, but so is trusting me. If I were really trying to trick you, I wouldn't ask something so unreasonable as that you trust us both. But frankly I consider knocking Italy down a peg to be the sole most urgent thing we can do to keep this game viable for any of us.  My proposal is: NWG-Cly, Nth convoy Hol-Yor, Eng-IRI or Wal, Bel s Bre-Eng, Pic-Bre, Par-Pic, Bur-Par, Mun-Bur (I figure I'm about to lose Mun anyway, and if that happens I'll disband my Hel fleet) Next year we'll be well-positioned to boot Italy off the island and the iberian. What do you think?",False,1,2,germany,england,552,2296
8,"(this part is not for copy-pasting to Italy) I designed this plan to make it look safe for Italy to convoy Gas-Lvp. I know this is what they'd really like to do. I think we need to do everything we can to try and disrupt this. I know it's a riskier move trying to assist Bre into Mao but I think it's the right one. I also think that for *extra* insurance NWG should poke NAO, because worst-case scenario Italy doesn't try the convoy and moves Nao-Lvp and also moves Mao-Nao to bounce. This guarantees Bre makes it into Mao which strengthens our ability to take the southern holdings, and at worst only sets you back a turn in terms of kicking Italy out of Liverpool. In exchange for doing this riskier move, I agree to convoy to york instead of Edi and give up my build. That part of the fake plan is actually true",True,1,2,germany,england,553,2297

8,"That‚Äôs fair, it could be a bounce we expect from you. Keep in mind that the French fleet disbands in the fall, assuming it leaves Bre. So if it gets into MAO, it will then vacate by spring",True,1,-2,england,germany,558,2302
8,"Better to vacate Mao than Gas, I think.",True,1,2,germany,england,559,2303

8,"You mean to Italy? I do think it's worth it, because Italy will realize that I'll turn to you if I'm no longer allied with him. By reporting the plan, you cement Italy's trust in *you*. If you didn't report the plan, Italy'd suspect you. It also gives Italy a false sense of confidence in what I'll do.  Tentative request: after the stab goes through, do I have your permission to send Italy the quotes from Italy that you've sent me?

We have a shot that at least one of these moves will get us somewhere. But I recognize this plan is nowhere near as sure a thing as if you just cooperated with Italy.

8,Hmm something tells me that you wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be out committing violent crimes haha. But then again how well do i really know you from playing a lying game. I will say I‚Äôd be down to do an in-person one with CS students at some point.,True,1,-1,england,germany,632,2487
8,Btw all other powers (me included) will be setting for a 5-way draw this move.,True,1,-1,england,germany,633,2495
8,I had been thinking the same thing! Do you know anyone besides me and admin at UMD who plays?  Uh huh...sureee they will,True,1,1,germany,england,634,2496
8,"AFAIK there's no drawback to submitting the draw order (if you're ok with the outcome). If there's not consensus, play just continues as normal. Well I think admin' adviser has played. I know [redacted] had expressed interest in playing. Not sure about students though.",True,1,-1,england,germany,635,2497

I'd also like to add that I'll be checking the ""Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders"" box. If everyone does this maybe we don't have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I'm not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw.

8,So did I! And I have no clue who wasn't on board,True,1,1,germany,england,642,2541
8,I guess we try the draw again?? I suppose it‚Äôs possible a game could be set up to not support the regular draw settings. I dunno.,True,1,-1,england,germany,643,2542

8,Any guesses on who is holding out on the draw?,True,1,-1,england,germany,647,2567
8,who keeps screwing with the draw though! Do you think Italy suggested it just to mess with all of us?,True,1,1,germany,england,648,2568
8,oh haha we just asked the same thing,True,1,1,germany,england,649,2569
8,"That‚Äôs my best guess. He‚Äôs kind of the only one with the incentive to keep it going. And with his winning track record, probably the only one who cares enough to be this sneaky",True,1,-1,england,germany,650,2570
8,well I'm honestly not invested enough to care if that happens anyway,True,1,1,germany,england,651,2572

8,Yep!,True,1,1,germany,england,663,2585

8,"Wait I'm actually doing our moves wrong if we want to hold paris. I need to attack Gas from Bre. Otherwise, Eng cuts Bre support, Gas supports Bur to Par. So I'm going to do that instead.",True,1,-1,england,germany,665,2589
8,I'm doing my moves wrong*,True,1,-1,england,germany,666,2590

8,Looks like it all worked. A little surprised about the supported move into brest. Do you want it?,True,1,-1,england,germany,668,2595
8,"Looking at the board a bit more, we'll have to be clever to keep Italy from any more centers on our side of the board. I think the following will do it: Bre and Par to Gas, Ruh to Bur, channel to MAO, NTH to NWG. We can ask russia to attack Tyr to cut support (Tri is going to fall anyways). I can hold the island as long as Yor doesn't attack me.",True,1,-1,england,germany,669,2602

10,"Good point. Sea tiger sounds more menacing anyway.   It all depends on how you like to play Germany and your relationship with Russia. I can be flexible, and if it makes sense for me to have Belgium to set up for a future play then that is good with me.",True,1,0,france,germany,4,62

These armies can't go on water, they can't move past Gascony/Paris/Marseilles as my units will soon be there, and so the only places to go for your armies are Ruhr... and that's about it. Isn't this a huge traffic jam? Wouldn't you be hemming yourself in even more by building armies? That's what I mean by it will be devastating to both of us to get into an army war and let England control the entire ocean. We're bidding over such a small area of land.",True,1,0,france,germany,26,321

I wish we were able to work something out so that both of us would have some fleets at least. But rihgt now England has 4 fleets and you have 1 and I have 2. And he's going to blow up your fleet in Holland this turn, it's basically a guarantee.",NOANNOTATION,0,2,france,germany,36,624

10,"Hmm. That's a good point. And Kiel is probably busy defending Berlin/Munich since Russia is in the Baltic and Silesia and could double team you with Italy. It's funny, there are so many units at your doorstep, but you might end up keeping all your dots this turn.",True,1,2,france,germany,44,680

10,"I honestly do, since I think your growth potential is going to be limited by the fact that we both have way too many armies and not enough fleets. So this means that your growth is limited to Paris/Belgium, and that's if you make it past 4 armies.",True,1,2,france,germany,53,796

10,"Actually, I'd have to build the fleet in Kiel, I think",True,1,-2,germany,france,59,834
10,1. I have. We're both trying our best to defend ourselves from England- we're too far from eachother for tactical manuevering but so far we've managed to avoid any losses,True,1,2,france,germany,60,861
10,"2. Despite Italian incoming invasion, I am still completely focused on taking the Channel, as that will give me much needed breathing room. If Holland can move to the North Sea, it will cut support and I will take EC",True,1,2,france,germany,61,862
10,"3. I am withdrawing from Ruhr. I know this leaves me open to you taking it back and working with England to capture Belgium in the fall. I can't think of another way to get you a center, so my promise is that if the board doesn't shake up somehow I'll give you Belgium either this turn or next turn on the condition that you build a fleet",True,1,2,france,germany,62,863
10,"That's correct, you can build a fleet from Kiel or from Berlin but not from Holland. You need to make sure one of those is vacated during the Winter phase. Vacating Kiel can be dangerous as England is in Denmark and could in theory take Kiel from you.",True,1,2,france,germany,63,865
10,I will vacate Belgium in the fall for you. Not yet sure what the best way to do it would be to make sure we don't lose it or Holland to an English fleet.,True,1,2,france,germany,64,867
10,I know England has their eye on sweden so we'll see how that baltic region shapes up next turn and that will determine where I build my fleet.,True,1,-2,germany,france,65,870

10,"oh wait nevermind I can prevent that if I keep my fleet in Holland and prevent Nth support twice. But this means I need to move Kiel into Ruhr during the spring to take my sweet, promised belgium in the fall. Picardy will have to support my movement of Ruhr into Belgium and you'll have to disband the unit. That's all fine, right?",False,1,-2,germany,france,71,881

10,"Losing the channel might be rough, that's true. Hmm, I actually hadn't thought too much about it. I think if he does that at the very least I can retreat into Wales and threaten Liverpool (assuming that Wales goes to cover London)",True,1,2,france,germany,74,898
10,"Give me a reason to defend myself against Italy. As it stands, I'm just going to let him solo.",True,1,2,france,germany,75,900
10,What do you think Italy is going to do once he kills me?,True,1,2,france,germany,76,902
10,Don't you agree that Austria will need somewhere to go with all his armies?,True,1,2,france,germany,77,903
10,I swear. I'm trying my hardest to work with you.,True,1,2,france,germany,78,904
10,"Look. I will defend myself against Italy. But I need to know that I will be in the draw. If you and England are just going to fuck me from behind, then there is no incentive for me to defend myself against Italy.",True,1,2,france,germany,79,905
10,"Hey, I really am sorry about the stab. You probably won't believe me but let me explain myself:  I knew I was making a deal with the devil when I agreed to help England, but England, Italy, Austria, and Russia were/are basically all allied and I figured it was either you or me they turned on. The turning point was when I realized that after I stab England you might not even hold the channel anyway. I couldn't afford to risk fury from all sides.   But now I'm in a potentially very good position for you: England and Italy *trust* me. I am in the process of finding out--under no suspicion, mind you, because of our alliance and shared plans--their moves for this season. Once I learn those, I can relay them to you.",True,1,-2,germany,france,80,916
10,"Doing so would clearly be in my interest. The longer you're in the running, the longer I escape getting devoured myself on three or more fronts.",True,1,-2,germany,france,81,917
10,"If you manage to look just lucky or smart by making the right moves to counter their attacks this season, I can continue to double-agent and help keep you defended and possibly even expanded into England.  I just spoke with England and I can confirm that you will be able to take the channel if you want to--they're supporting me into Belgium from Nth.   I can't be as direct asking this of Italy, but I'm trying to figure out whether they're going to use the lion's share of their force against Marseilles or Spain. If I can figure this out you may have a better chance of holding.  I'm going to send the info your way whether you believe me or not.",True,1,-2,germany,france,82,919
10,Ok. I get that- I'm sorry for not explaining it well. Losing the channel doesn't matter to me. It gives me excellent retreat options and allows me to defend myself against Italy without worrying about what England is up to.,True,1,2,france,germany,83,922
10,There's no way Russia is allied with Italy and Austria. Just look at how aggressive Austria is in attacking Russia...,True,1,2,france,germany,84,923
10,Nothing can be done at this point though. Thanks for the offer of intel- this is basically all I wanted to hear. As long as I have a chance to be in the draw I won't give up and maybe something will shake up and give me a chance to recover,True,1,2,france,germany,85,924
10,You should work on England- he's not even communicating with me. I must have done something to piss him off. But if he keeps this up it's going to end badly for him too.,True,1,2,france,germany,86,925
10,"For the future, let me know in advance when you are planning something like this. If I knew you were not cutting the North Sea I would have played this way differently by bouncing Italy out of the West Med, and we'd be in a much stronger position.",True,1,2,france,germany,87,926
10,"It‚Äôs not that Russia is allied with austria, but Russia is cooperating strongly with England to the point that they don‚Äôt even talk to me. For what it‚Äôs worth, I can confirm that Italy‚Äôs going to shoot for Spain.",True,1,-2,germany,france,88,928

10,Just given that they seem to be fighting in Scandinavia. But you probably have more information than I do.,True,1,2,france,germany,92,952
10,"By the way, what's the plan that Italy and England proposed to you in terms of your units? Are you attacking Burgundy with ruhr and Munich?",True,1,2,france,germany,93,953
10,Oh that's not a fight that's planned high-fives. At least according to England. Nope--attacking Belgium with Ruhr and Amsterdam. We're in the process of discussing whether Munich should bother poking Belgium.,True,1,-2,germany,france,94,955
10,Burgundy*,True,1,-2,germany,france,95,956
10,I take back what I said about Italy shooting for spain. I thought it was decided but Italy wants to keep that decision to themself,True,1,-2,germany,france,96,976
10,Thanks. I'm probably going to flip a coin for Spain/Marseilles. Has England expressed any concern over the Italian/Austrian growth? I worry that England has been charmed by Italy. Or maybe they just dislike me that much.,True,1,2,france,germany,97,983

10,Is it okay if I ask Italy about it?,True,1,1,germany,france,160,1556
10,"That's fair. It might be best to not ask Italy directly, but that is up to you (just because it seemed that if Italy is actually serious about this proposal, they would want the element of surprise).

Neither of these plans has you staying in Brest. If you're willing to do either of those things (help with an Italy stab or more English destruction) at the expense of Brest, let me know and let me know which you'd prefer.

15,Looked like fun. I guess you won't be getting that build this year though.,True,1,0,england,russia,62,1255
15,"Oh, probably not -they'd have to really screw the pooch to let me build. But it is fun to keep them tied up.",True,1,0,russia,england,63,1314

15,"Yeah sorry to open the floor to discussion with a stab. I did need the build, and getting two was far from a guarantee for me (even though it turned out that way). I think we have a lot to discuss. How are you feeling about the state of the board?",True,1,1,england,russia,68,2426
15,"I'm kinda happy there's finally some movement, to be honest. And Austria's finally responding to messages after a two year silence. I think we're on a stop the leader phase which does have some opportunities for us, specifically",True,1,-1,russia,england,69,2428
15,"I agree. Running through some tactics, I see that Italy can hold his western dots until he's forced to disband. I think we'll need to see two disbands, maybe three, before we can break through.",True,1,1,england,russia,70,2437
15,"Hi. Given that the beta test ends in 1909, wanted to check in about your goals (i.e. thoughts on a draw?)",True,1,1,england,russia,71,2488
15,"To be honest, I totally forgot about the end date.  I dunno - the only person who can even theoretically be removed by then is Austria, so we'll just see how that shakes out",True,1,-1,russia,england,72,2491
15,"Yeah I think he said 1910 if we really wanted. But we are just the beta test. Italy austria and I have agreed on a 5-way draw. Germany wants to play out, but might be swayed if everyone else is on board.",True,1,1,england,russia,73,2492
15,"Ah, good point - I have the draw set now.",True,1,-1,russia,england,74,2493
15,"Me too. Do you know how the draws get resolved? Germany is the last hold-out, and I think she's skeptical that she'll get duped somehow if she sets it as such. I thought it's just that play proceeds as normal unless everybody agrees to the same thing.",True,1,1,england,russia,75,2498
15,"That's correct - it will only pass if it's unanimous, or at least until everyone's draw setting is compatible.  For example, if four set it as four way draw, and one set as surrender, that's compatible with a four way draw excluding the surrendering power",True,1,-1,russia,england,76,2510
15,"Reply all to Italy's message: First, if you didn't get a message from Italy claiming to have been sent to the whole board, please let me know. I'm down for the draw that he has proposed. I'd also like to add that I'll be checking the ""Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders"" box. If everyone does this maybe we don't have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I'm not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw. Really enjoyed playing with you all, but I'm exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats.",True,1,1,england,russia,77,2521

17,Hey! I'm pretty flexible. Do you like to open north or against Germany?,True,1,-1,france,russia,1,15
17,Not especially - depends on how squirrelly the English player comes off in initial negotiations.  So far he's scanning as moderately squirrelly üòÉ,True,1,1,russia,france,2,36
17,Haha üòÇ. Moderately squirrelly is pretty accurate.,True,1,-1,france,russia,3,40
17,"Checking back in before the deadline- it's a bit uncertain in the West, and it would be interesting to hear about your read.",True,1,-1,france,russia,4,141
17,"Looks like Italy's gonna head away from you pretty aggressively.  England still strikes me as squirrelly - he says he's super-concerned about Germany, but I'm not sure I'm buying that.",True,1,1,russia,france,5,142
17,"Thanks- that's great to hear and is confirming what I have been gathering. England is especially hard to read and I'm not sure I buy that either, but at least he's also telling me that he is worried about Germany.",True,1,-1,france,russia,6,149

17,Just wanted to say that your moves this turn were really something. Well played!,True,1,0,france,russia,10,455
17,You as well. Looks like you have your territory well defended now.,True,1,0,russia,france,11,458

17,"Not strong ones. I feel like I need to cover my ass, but aside from that?",True,1,0,russia,france,18,660

What's stopping me from throwing is Germany asking me not to. And then she took Belgium, lol.",True,1,0,france,russia,24,1057
17,Not sure what my game plan is here. Right now I'm working on getting Germany to build a fleet. My theory is that if Germany can pivot towards England then it may be a salvageable game. Eliminating England ASAP and there's a possibility we can end up in a draw once AI tensions build. But that is impossible if they see a weak north full of infighting that they can just roll over- then they have no reason to ever turn on eachother.,True,1,0,france,russia,25,1058
17,"Yep.  I have the south stopped cold at this point - and I told Austria after the Winter turn they would get two and then be stuck - but that means y'all gotta work your shit out and lock the other side, or this is an AI steamroll",True,1,0,russia,france,26,1059

19,Bonjour! Let's talk about the English channel!,True,1,0,england,france,0,22
19,Sure! What are your thoughts on it?,True,1,0,france,england,1,25
19,I'd like to leave it unoccupied. A fight early on is bad for both of us.,True,1,0,england,france,2,27
19,"Makes sense. I agree, a DMZ is good for us both. I know that getting armies off of the island is pretty important for you. Depending on how it plays out we could talk about Belgium. Any thoughts on your other neighbors Germany and Russia?",True,1,0,france,england,3,31
19,"Cool, I'd like to then agree now to a DMZ in the channel through the end of 1902, and we can re-discuss that year about future plans. Are you on board? If so, will your fleet go to MAO?  Haven't heard from Germany yet. I've been honest with Russia about going north, and Russia has expressed some concerns. Doesn't want me to bring my army to Nwy. So, Belgium may be a home I'm interested in if that's on the table.",True,1,0,england,france,4,38
19,Wow Germany threatens war with me in the first message haha,True,1,0,england,france,5,54
19,"Yes, and yes. I will open to MAO. If Russia is adamantly against you putting an army in Norway, it might be worth it to not antagonize him provided that Russia and Germany are not working together. Belgium is definitely on the table",True,1,0,france,england,6,55
19,"Interesting haha, that is unusual",True,1,0,france,england,7,58
19,"Yeah, something tells me that player may be a little unpredictable. Sounds good on the agreement.  For Belgium, is there something you would want from me for you to give that up? Are you saying you may consider supporting me in? I don't think Germany will be thrilled about me being there.",True,1,0,england,france,8,63
19,"All of that makes sense. Let's revisit before the fall orders then. I wouldn't be totally opposed to the idea of an attack on Germany, especially if he's not willing to engage in any meaningful discussion.",True,1,0,england,france,10,68
19,FYI Germany has indicated he is taking his fleet to Holland in the Spring.,True,1,0,england,france,11,109
19,"Thanks for the heads up! That is an interesting choice, I think it may indicate a Russia/Germany agreement of some kind as it means Russia will be getting Sweden.",True,1,0,france,england,12,111
19,"Yeah, you may be right. Have you heard from Germany at all? Or Russia?",True,1,0,england,france,13,114
19,"Yeah I'm not getting much from them either. In a remote game it's hard to tell if people are being quiet on purpose or just not making themselves available on the chat. (This is my first time playing remote, so a bit of a different experience for me).",True,1,0,england,france,15,129
19,"Yeah, that is definitely one of the downsides of online diplomacy. By the way, we're still good with the channel, right? I know you must be anxious if Germany and Russia are not talking to you much, but I have to stress that this is not because I am working with them, and I am not moving to the channel.",True,1,0,france,england,16,138
19,"I am not going to the channel. We've agreed to keep out at least through the end of 1902, and I plan to uphold this. However, that message did make me a little nervous about your plans. Breaking an explicit agreement like that is cause for war in my book.",True,1,0,england,france,17,144
19,That wasn't my intention at all and I am very glad that we are on the same page. Sorry if it came across like I don't trust you: I trust you which is why I hoped to bring up any potential worries before they happen. I could have worded it better üòÖ .,True,1,0,france,england,18,146

19,"My read: Germany gets a pretty good start, facing only a bit of aggression from you.. Austria and Turkey are likely agreed to stand strong against Russia. However, I think there's a chance that Turkey is sort of overselling their ""opposition"" to Russia moving to Arm. There may be a juggernaut alliance in the works. Probably no real conflict between Austria and Italy. Maybe they'll bounce in Trieste. Austria has a pretty good start if he can secure Greece.",True,1,0,england,france,23,168
19,Do you plan to take Belgium from Pic or Bur?,True,1,0,england,france,24,170
19,And here I thought Belgium was on the table. I guess it's already on your plate then? What's to stop me from working with the Germans to keep you out?,True,1,0,england,france,26,202
19,"Belgium IS on the table. But I didn't expect these spring moves, and with the way the map looks, I think you need to convince me that it would be worth it for me to be on 4 with you on 5. Totally different discussion if Italy is in Tyrolia, or if Germany bounced me out of Burgundy",False,1,0,france,england,27,219
19,"I'm looking at it from your point of view too, I think you have options other than Belgium, right? You could take Denmark for example.",False,1,0,france,england,28,220
19,"I can't take Denmark by force, and Germany isn't keen on letting me have it. The way I see it you'll easily take Portugal next year (assuming you go Spain s.c. with your fleet). And that line on Pic-Bur-Mar (assuming you build there) would make you really strong. Meanwhile I'm struggling to find a fifth supply center next year. Russia probably helps out germany with Denmark. So I'm looking at St. Petersburg at that point?",True,1,0,england,france,29,223
19,What can you offer to balance this out if I let you in?,True,1,0,england,france,30,224
19,"I've had some time to think about it since the bot was down, and you are right about concerns over fairness. At the end of the day, the plan doesn't matter unless you are on board with it. If you are going to demand Belgium I'd rather support you in than bounce with you.",True,1,0,france,england,31,228
19,"If you can forgo Belgium this turn, we do have an opportunity to put you into Holland and/or Denmark next year, and that will quickly snowball into Scandinavia, Kiel, etc.",False,1,0,france,england,32,229
19,You're suggesting I get a fleet in NTH and HEL? I think that's the only way to make that work. I would want no fleet built in Bre and our DMZ extended through at least the end of 1903. And probably one other country on board with the takedown. If we're stabbing Germany we should make sure she's taken out swiftly.,True,1,0,england,france,33,232
19,"I think that's the best way to do it, yeah. I agree to no fleet build in Brest and an extension to our DMZ to the end of 1903. The one thing I cannot guarantee is another country involved in the take down, but the best suspects would likely be Russia followed by Italy.",True,1,0,france,england,34,235

19,"Not saying you are the big winner, I'm saying that your misorder was probably a good thing. Before we get into the details of an alliance against Germany, I think it's worth noting that the AI alliance is going to absolutely roll over Russia/Turkey, and so if you take Russia's dots that are easy to take, I think it will be helping Germany/Austria/Italy more than it helps you.",True,1,1,france,england,50,265

This gives me some leverage in negotiating with Russia.",True,1,-1,england,france,56,271

19,Ok I think that's all of my messages for now.,True,1,-1,england,france,59,274
19,"It's possible, but I think Austria and Turkey are not friendly given the fact that Austria did not move Serbia to Rumania and Turkey tried to support that move. Russia is definitely still in trouble, though the target might be Turkey first.",True,1,1,france,england,60,287
19,"I have to build armies, no fleet in Brest.",True,1,1,france,england,61,288
19,Denmark is a guarantee if you can get a fleet into Skaggerak and have Russia support you in. It then becomes a 3V2,True,1,1,france,england,62,289
19,"You could even do a clever tactic with Russia moving to Baltic, you moving to Sweden, and Skaggerak/north sea. Then it is a 4V2",True,1,1,france,england,63,290
19,Ok so guarantee based on Russian collaboration. So you don't think Russia and Germany are friends anymore? I suppose they don't have many favors to offer one another,True,1,-1,england,france,64,292
19,"I'm building a fleet in London. I hope that doesn't raise any alarms on your end. But if you were to build a fleet in Bre against your promise, any other build would leave me in bad shape. I know I'm being paranoid, but I'm more comfortable with that build",True,1,-1,england,france,66,294
19,"Ok. I don't get why you think I'd build F Brest, but at the very least I appreciate the heads up. At some point I'd like to see you make a decisive move. So far it seems like you've been trying to make moves that both Germany and I agree to.",True,1,1,france,england,67,296
19,"You could break  DMZ in the channel and coordinate an invasion with Germany after building a fleet in Brest. By building in London I can do everything I might like to do eastward, and also i could respond better to a worst-case scenario.",True,1,-1,england,france,68,298
19,And what would have been my decisive move so far? A bump in Denmark? You were going to support me into Belgium so why would I have done that?,True,1,-1,england,france,69,300
19,Sometimes the less options you have the better off you are. A lot of diplomacy is signalling.,True,1,1,france,england,70,301
19,"I mean, my thinking process last turn was wondering why you didn't go to Denmark. My conclusion was that Germany was probably supporting you to Belgium. I'm just telling you the vibes I'm getting from you",True,1,1,france,england,71,302
19,"Germany ""was"" supporting me to Belgium and then didn't follow through",True,1,-1,england,france,72,304
19,That's really interesting haha,True,1,1,france,england,73,305
19,Yeah so here I was thinking I had it in the bag. And then I first realized I flubbed my move and felt like an idiot. And then I looked closer and felt like an accidental genius.,True,1,-1,england,france,74,307
19,"So back to signaling. You backed out of your, admittedly, vague and implied agreement to support me. What signal does that send to me? Are you saying that you're coming for me? That I can't totally trust you?",True,1,-1,england,france,75,308
19,"Meanwhile, I've been totally honest with you for the sake of building trust and a good alliance. And you're going to complain about MY duplicity?",True,1,-1,england,france,76,309
19,"So, I know this is a touchy subject, so I want to approach this delicately, but to be fair I was still deciding whether I would support you or not when you logged out for the night. I don't want to devolve this into ""what about when you did this thing that wasn't the best signal,"" but one of the things for me was considering why you weren't willing to move to Denmark. Sure, you want Belgium, but what does that mean for me when you want to put a fleet in Belgium and not an army? What is the follow-up play?",True,1,1,france,england,77,317
19,"Yeah, that's all fair. The timing thing makes remote play kind of weird when there's a lapse in communication before an important move. We didn't really have a chance to talk about the fleet vs army there.",True,1,-1,england,france,79,319
19,But I don't get why you don't think I've been working with you. You proposed two possibilities: Belgium or Holland/Denmark in 1902. I expressed my preference after raising some concerns about Germany's ability to counter Holland/Denmark. You agreed to help me to Belgium.,True,1,-1,england,france,80,320
19,"If you think commitment to a sole country is a good strategy, why haven't you followed it? Would you agree that I've been more committed to working with you than you have with me? That's pretty clear from your moves last turn.",True,1,-1,england,france,81,322
19,"All great points- and I agree with you on a lot of this. I was very willing to support you to Belgium, but I should have made it more clear that it needed to be an army. I do believe commitment is a good strategy, which is what led me to some admittedly anti-German opening moves. I'm not saying you have not shown commitment, after all we have an excellent DMZ in the channel, but it does bug me a bit that I cannot identify something you have done to antagonize Germany.",True,1,1,france,england,82,323
19,Well what would you like me to do to show this antagonism next year? Make the goal to secure denmark?,True,1,-1,england,france,83,324
19,Yes- I would very much love to see that. And the best part is that you get to see my super friendly builds before you decide on anything.,True,1,1,france,england,84,325
19,"Alright, this sounds good. Let's reconvene after builds then? That's Monday at noon right? It's probably time for me to get back to real life here haha.",True,1,-1,england,france,85,327
19,"Sounds great, me too haha.",True,1,1,france,england,86,328
19,Thoughts on builds?,True,1,1,france,england,87,345
19,"I have similar thoughts. I think that Russia and Turkey are both in a weak spot and all the evidence so far points towards them getting involved in a long and drawn out conflict. I'm sure Russia would have loved to build St Petersburg but couldn't afford to. Now, he is pretty much completely under your good graces. Austria and Italy may very well team up to take Munich.",True,1,1,france,england,89,373
19,"Germany's builds have come out to be very anti-French, so I am sure you are happy about those as well. It comes at the cost of cutting down the amount of options he has significantly. What do you think Germany might order?",True,1,1,france,england,90,374
19,"Trying to get a sense of the german plan now. I feel like germany has to play defense, unless they did something like Mun to Ruh to support into Bel or Bur to Gas to put pressure on Bre in the fall.",True,1,-1,england,france,91,383
19,"Yeah, I do to. I was thinking that my best play might be to ignore Burgundy and hope it holds and instead go for something annoying like Holland or Ruhr, which would leave him to either withdraw to defend or leave himself prone in the North. Of course, it could backfire if he's thinking the same thing and ends up in Gascony.",True,0,1,france,england,92,392
19,I'm trying to reason through how that plays out. Suppose germany supports Bur to Ruh with Bel. Then you can't penetrate right?,True,1,-1,england,france,93,393
19,"Yes, if he moves Bur to Ruhr with support I can't get in. But it would also mean he's out of Burgundy, which is good for me and means if I retake Burgundy that I can start applying pressure to Ruhr and Munich",True,1,1,france,england,94,395
19,"If he moves Kiel to ruhr, he leaves all sorts of things completely exposed like Denmark. And if he leaves Munich he leaves that open as well",True,1,1,france,england,95,396
19,"Yeah, germany is in a tough spot. Any word from Italy in all this? I'm guessing the lepanto is the focus, but a move to either Pie or Tyr would be kind of taking a side.",True,1,-1,england,france,96,399
19,"True. He said he was thinking about it, but not sure how much I can trust that. He'd certainly want to obscure moving to Piedmont if that is his plan.",True,1,1,france,england,97,401
19,"I know channel is tempting. If you think it might work, I'd totally support you to Holland, or I can tap Holland to make sure it can't leave by going to Helgoland without losing it. Moving to Helgoland or Skaggerak yourself can also be a strong play, especially if Germany thinks you are on his side. A move to skagg can be explained as a move on Russia and a move to Helgoland is deadly if it succeeds",True,1,1,france,england,98,402

19,Confirmed.,True,1,1,france,england,102,442
19,Hopefully that got to you on time üò¨,True,1,1,france,england,103,443
19,"Yeah, I'm here. I'm moving to Nth and Hel, holding in the others.",True,1,-1,england,france,104,444
19,I'd like one of Holland or Denmark this year. Both would be nice but maybe not feasible.,True,1,-1,england,france,105,445
19,Let's see Germany's Spring moves and restrategize.,True,1,-1,england,france,106,446
19,Sounds great!,True,1,1,france,england,107,447
19,I will go to Ruhr then to apply some pressure there. Hopefully I'll make the right guesses when it comes to what Germany will do with burgundy. I believe that we can get you Denmark or Holland but it may require some clever manuevering in the fall.,True,1,1,france,england,108,448
19,Are you self-bouncing in Gas to prevent the move there?,True,1,-1,england,france,109,449
19,That's a great option. I might change my moves to that actually. I have something more risky in mind at the moment though,True,1,1,france,england,110,450
19,"Nice, that worked out really well actually. Well done on taking the Helgoland Blight! That was a great call, and it means we can guarantee Holland for you next turn. Burgundy might retreat to Marseilles which is annoying, but manageable.  Or it could retreat to Munich. Very interesting that Russia made an aggressive move towards you.",True,1,1,france,england,111,451
19,"Nah, that was planned. Russia's trying to keep good graces with germany before helping me to denmark in the fall. I can't do this if I'm going for Holland though.",True,1,-1,england,france,112,452
19,I'm a little surprised austria and italy are totally staying out the fight. I guess they're really going for turkey.,True,1,-1,england,france,113,453
19,"Even better! If Russia is helping you with Denmark I can apply some pressure on Ruhr, and cracking that key position means that on the next turn we start threatening home centers like Kiel and will be in excellent shape to tackle Holland on the next year. Depends how much you trust Russia- seems like he's been radio silent for me, but then again we don't have a lot to talk about.",True,1,1,france,england,114,454
19,"Yeah the moves in the east are pretty crazy actually. They are going hard against Turkey, and Russia made some excellent moves it looks like so Turkey is in a very tough spot.",True,1,1,france,england,115,456
19,"Agreed we're in good shape. Though I imagine after these moves germany will make a hard play for russian support. If I can indeed trust russia, I'll convoy an army from Norway to Denmark and cut support from Kiel with HEL.",True,1,-1,england,france,116,462
19,I wonder if there's anything to offer Russia to sweeten the deal?,True,1,-1,england,france,117,465
19,"Great points. I think Russia may plan to further develop in the south, especially if he and Italy work something out against Austria, or if Austria and he work something out against Italy. If that's the case, he may just want the peace of mind that you are not going to attack him for a while. Otherwise, probably a German dot if he plans to play in the north.",True,1,1,france,england,118,468
19,"Looking back at the map, probably Berlin would be the best bet for a dot offer since Russia could take that with an army (after traveling to Prussia/Silesia from Warsaw) or with the fleet in Sweden (by traveling to the Baltic first).",True,1,1,france,england,119,474
19,Yeah that's what I was thinking. Russia seems fine to support without it.,True,1,-1,england,france,120,475

19,"Nice, that went well",True,1,1,france,england,123,565
19,Sorry for the late notice. Just a heads up that I plan to build a fleet in Brest but will park it in the MAO as a deterrent to Italy,False,1,1,france,england,124,566
19,Can you explain why you didn‚Äôt build it in Mar?,True,1,-1,england,france,125,620
19,"Yeah, sure. I couldn't build it in Marseilles because there would be very little I could tell Italy to persuade him that I wasn't planning to attack him with that build, even though that isn't my intention.",False,1,1,france,england,126,629
19,"What's the plan on the German front? Maybe we can get creative with the moves in a way that gets both of us at least one dot. I'm not holding myy breath on Ruhr, so I think the best play might be to send Belgium to Holland with support from the north sea while Denmark hits Kiel with support from Helgoland. If Germany makes similar moves to her last turn, we would pop both Kiel and Holland and would guarantee Munich/Berlin for next year. If Germany supports Kiel instead of moving to Ruhr, then we would guarantee Kiel in the fall as I'd walk into Ruhr and we would have Ruhr, Holland, Helgoland, and Denmark for a 4V3.",True,1,1,france,england,127,631

27,Thoughts on Russia?,True,1,0,austria,germany,36,367
27,Idk. I‚Äôm probably going to let him take Sweden as long as we agree on him not attacking Ber,True,1,0,germany,austria,37,368
27,Idk if I can trust that he would and I cannot afford to lose it obviously,True,1,0,germany,austria,38,369
27,Why?,True,1,0,germany,austria,40,371
27,"Regardless of if he keeps his word with Ber (and he has no real reason to), he has three units up north and there is nowhere productive for them to go either than retreat or back into you.  The more builds he has that he can commit up north, the more he can just overwhelm you",False,1,0,austria,germany,41,372
27,Well he could go south. He could focus on Turkey,True,1,0,germany,austria,42,373

27,Not at the moment. Not with Russia breathing down my neck. Do you have a deal with Russia?  Its hard to imagine he chose not to War>Gal without working something out with you.,True,1,0,germany,austria,55,476
27,My deal with Russia is that he's an idiot.  I'm moving on him here.  Just block him is Sweden and make my job easier.  I'm trying to cripple him to help you out a bit,True,1,0,austria,germany,56,477
27,He can't even convoy from Lvn. He just doeant know what he's doing,True,1,0,austria,germany,57,478

27,It isn't going at you.  Austria and Germany rarely attack each other.,True,1,0,austria,germany,82,619
27,Right that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping too,True,1,0,germany,austria,83,621

28,I‚Äôm hoping to get along well with you and England and focus on France. I think the three of us need to get in front of things and envision what Scandinavia looks like in two years,False,1,-1,germany,russia,5,296
28,I honestly don‚Äôt know what the heck France is doing to not even take Spain with their first turn one. That seems like a pretty obvious move. I would like Sweden for another supply center.

28,Think you have to worry more about England right now. I‚Äôm going to be locked down in the south trying to deal with Turkey. England can eventually take Sweden unless you support me moving there. Then you can block England from getting it and it gives me some life in my fight down south with a new supply center. Otherwise I‚Äôm not gonna last very long most likely and you‚Äôll be dealing with England by yourself.,True,1,-2,russia,germany,17,759
28,Yes. Happy to let you move into Sweden. What should I say to Turkey about you not going into Ber?,True,1,2,germany,russia,18,761

28,Let me know you saw this,True,1,2,germany,russia,36,1055
28,"Long term, I think the best I can do for you is let you keep sweden so you can move your fleet and try to reclaim stp",True,1,2,germany,russia,37,1056
28,Then you can potentially recover a build and stay alive,True,1,2,germany,russia,38,1057
28,"Many of the other players seem to have written you off for dead, but I am down to do what I can to keep you alive.",True,1,2,germany,russia,39,1058

29,Hey England! Looking forward to this game. How are you this afternoon?,True,1,0,germany,england,0,35
29,Hello there. I‚Äôm doing well although it‚Äôs the evening here on the east coast. Wondering where you stand with France and Russia. Will you bounce Sweden? Has France spoken to you about Belgium?,True,1,0,england,germany,1,138
29,East coast for me too üò¥,True,1,0,germany,england,2,139
29,France reached out to me but I haven‚Äôt responded,True,1,0,germany,england,3,140
29,Still determining my plans! I haven‚Äôt locked in any moves yet. Where do you stand with France?,True,1,0,germany,england,4,144
29,France asked me to bounce bur but I haven‚Äôt agreed to it yet. That‚Äôs all we‚Äôve communicated,True,1,0,germany,england,6,165
29,A lot of players are not very responsive,True,1,0,germany,england,7,166
29,Where are you based on the East Coast? I work in DC but I‚Äôm from Philly originally,True,1,0,germany,england,8,167
29,I‚Äôm in Boston but I live in SF. Originally from Boston. My work takes me here for about 1 week a month.,True,1,0,england,germany,9,169
29,"You‚Äôre so lucky that your job lets you go home. I try to get back to philly once every 6 weeks or so, but I have to use my weekends for it.",True,1,0,germany,england,10,170
29,I‚Äôm actually going to be in Palo Alto in August! I‚Äôve never been in those parts before,True,1,0,germany,england,11,171
29,Hey England! So we have a good deal to chat about. Are you planning to go into Hol? Nwy?,True,1,0,germany,england,12,317
29,Definitely gonna be taking Norway. Haven‚Äôt decided if fleet or army yet though. Are you going to bounce Russia?,True,0,0,england,germany,13,348
29,Ruhr and Hol probably,False,1,0,germany,england,15,462
29,But I‚Äôm not 100% sure,True,1,0,germany,england,16,463
29,I might move Mun to Ber to protect from Russia,True,1,0,germany,england,17,464
29,Hey there. What do you think about pushing further into France with me and Italy?,True,1,0,england,germany,18,771
29,Hey! I‚Äôm open to it. What are your thoughts on Sweden?,True,1,0,germany,england,19,772
29,Russia is asking me to support him into Sweden. I‚Äôd prefer if you just continue to bounce him out. So I can grab St. Pete. Then you can have Sweden.,True,1,0,england,germany,20,773
29,Sound like a plan?,True,1,0,england,germany,21,774
29,Hello,True,1,0,germany,england,22,887
29,"Hi, there",True,1,0,england,germany,23,895
29,Was that a friendly hello before the stab? Did you have something you wanted to discuss?,True,1,0,england,germany,24,932
29,Yeah I mean I hadn‚Äôt really heard from you so wanted to reach out.,False,1,0,germany,england,25,982
29,I would like to work something out with you. We both have a common rival in France at the moment.,False,1,0,germany,england,26,987
29,The last message before your hello was me asking you to help me against Russia. I hadn‚Äôt really heard from you. Not the other way around. Did you not receive that message? We should talk to the admins if so,True,1,0,england,germany,27,993
29,Would you be willing to support me into Paris?,True,1,0,england,germany,28,994
29,Yes and I responded. Did you get my response?,True,1,0,germany,england,29,995
29,I did not,True,1,0,england,germany,30,996
29,Hmm. Maybe it was when things were glitchy?,True,1,0,germany,england,31,997
29,I‚Äôll message the admin. Well what did you say?,True,1,0,england,germany,32,998
29,I would screen shot but I feel like that‚Äôs against the rules of the study,True,1,0,germany,england,33,999
29,‚ÄúHe‚Äôs asking for my support too. I‚Äôm not committal. I‚Äôm open to it because  he didn‚Äôt screw me in Ber last year.‚Äù,True,1,0,germany,england,34,1000
29,That‚Äôs why I stayed out of it,True,1,0,germany,england,35,1001
29,"Ok, let‚Äôs turn this partnership around.",True,1,0,england,germany,36,1002
29,Russia is a goner.  Austria is the next biggest threat once we deal with France.,True,1,0,england,germany,37,1003
29,Can I count on your support into Paris?,True,1,0,england,germany,38,1004
29,No I have the unit committed to supporting Italy,True,1,0,germany,england,39,1007
29,"Ah, ok. I‚Äôd like to avoid losing a dot if possible. Looking unlikely I guess.",True,1,0,england,germany,40,1009
29,"Well, that‚Äôs not true.",True,1,0,england,germany,41,1010
29,Maybe if I manage to hold Norway.,True,1,0,england,germany,42,1011
29,You should grab Sweden.,True,1,0,england,germany,43,1012
29,Just making sure you got my messages.,True,1,0,england,germany,44,1071
29,Yes sorry,True,1,0,germany,england,45,1083
29,I‚Äôm taking to Italy about how we split up France.,True,1,0,england,germany,46,1087
29,Any suggestions?,True,1,0,england,germany,47,1088
29,See I don‚Äôt know what I can realistically get out of that scenario.,True,1,0,germany,england,48,1089
29,Well you already have Belgium and Holland. Paris is all yours.  Italy can have marseille and Spain and I can take Brest and Portugal. What do you think of that? Then we all head east to face Austria and turkey.,True,1,0,england,germany,49,1123
29,That is if Austria doesn‚Äôt stab Italy first,True,1,0,england,germany,50,1125
29,And you don‚Äôt stab me,True,1,0,england,germany,51,1127
29,You heading east goes right through me tho.,True,1,0,germany,england,52,1130
29,"No, I plan on going through Russia. I want to land in Scandinavia and move from there.",True,1,0,england,germany,53,1133
29,I need an ally near me. Russia is obviously out. The only other option at this stage is France or you. France has been very uncommunicative so I‚Äôd like it to be you.,True,1,0,england,germany,54,1136
29,I feel the same way.,True,1,0,germany,england,55,1138
29,"I have one additional term. I need control of the North Sea. If I have the North Sea, I can move my units  in Denmark Holland and Belgium away to focus on supporting other offences. I can‚Äôt risk being knifed in the back and cannot keep three units defending against the North Sea to feel safe.",True,1,0,germany,england,56,1140
29,I‚Äôve heard that Austria is one of the top ranked players in the world. Did you know this?,True,1,0,germany,england,57,1141
29,I didn‚Äôt know that.,True,1,0,england,germany,58,1143
29,I can‚Äôt leave the North Sea open for two reasons. The first is the same concern as yours. The second is I‚Äôll need it to convoy troops.,True,1,0,england,germany,59,1145
29,"Could you convoy through the channel? You would have my support. and I don‚Äôt mean open, I mean mine.",True,1,0,germany,england,60,1146
29,I guess I could convoy via Norwegian Sea but I still have the same concerns that you do except they‚Äôre my home centers!,True,1,0,england,germany,61,1147
29,1. I don‚Äôt blame you for a second,True,1,0,germany,england,62,1149
29,2. I‚Äôm attracted to this alliance because I do not want Austria to win. It would be so lame if we all lose to the top guy.,True,1,0,germany,england,64,1152
29,It can work but we just need to keep each other in check.,True,1,0,england,germany,65,1154
29,Yeah. If one of us gets too weak it becomes tempting. England- Germany alliance are very difficult.,True,1,0,germany,england,66,1156
29,Austria is going to get two builds. It‚Äôs unlikely peace can hold in the east.,True,1,0,germany,england,67,1157
29,"With you in the North Sea, I feel like I can‚Äôt leave Denmark or Holland undefended. But I understand with me there you will feel the same about Edinburough and London.",True,1,0,germany,england,68,1158
29,Do you know if Italy is going to try and take Smyrna?,True,1,0,england,germany,69,1159
29,I don‚Äôt.,True,1,0,germany,england,70,1160
29,You‚Äôre correct. While it would be nice to be able to move those units east. Let‚Äôs try and make it work with you staying there.,True,1,0,england,germany,71,1163
29,"I‚Äôm not on board with that. I can just have two units sitting around doing nothing just to be your pal, no offense.",True,1,0,germany,england,72,1176
29,So we let Austria roll?,True,1,0,england,germany,73,1178
29,Because it will be a grind between us while Austria gains momentum,True,1,0,england,germany,74,1181
29,Yeah but sometimes you have to take those kinds of risks.,True,1,0,germany,england,75,1184
29,What about a demilitarised North Sea. We agree to leave it open.,True,1,0,germany,england,76,1186
29,I‚Äôm way more amenable to that,True,1,0,england,germany,77,1242
29,Which is basically trust but verify.,True,1,0,germany,england,79,1246
29,But starting next season? I need to convoy into Norway this season.,True,1,0,england,germany,80,1247
29,Will you be taking Sweden?,True,1,0,england,germany,81,1248
29,Kinda depends on what we finalise here,True,1,0,germany,england,82,1257
29,"I mean I can. Russia knows he‚Äôs done, that would just be a final nail in the coffin.",True,1,0,germany,england,83,1258
29,"Ok, I‚Äôll be convoying into Norway this season. Next season I move into Norwegian Sea or channel depending on frances moves.",True,1,0,england,germany,84,1259
29,That‚Äôs gonna be a question we‚Äôll have to face later. I have no idea now.,True,1,0,england,germany,86,1265
29,All Italy cares about is France right now. No clue what his future plans hold.,True,1,0,england,germany,87,1266
29,Makes sense. He‚Äôs a good player. How long do you see these terms holding out? Does Paris still go to me?,True,1,0,germany,england,88,1276
29,"This strategy leaves me little room to build outside of heading east, which is my concern.",True,1,0,germany,england,89,1277
29,Yes you still get Paris,True,1,0,england,germany,90,1319
29,I‚Äôm not really sure. I hope we can can see this to the end.,True,1,0,england,germany,91,1322
29,Ok,True,1,0,germany,england,92,1361
29,For the record,True,1,0,germany,england,93,1362
29,I talked to Austria,True,1,0,germany,england,94,1363
29,And he was trying to talk me into attacking you,True,1,0,germany,england,95,1364
29,Taking the North Sea right now,True,1,0,germany,england,96,1365
29,Basically just knifing you while I ‚Äúhave the upper hand‚Äù,True,1,0,germany,england,97,1366
29,He‚Äôs talking to me to about going after you,True,0,0,england,germany,98,1367
29,No shit,True,1,0,germany,england,99,1368
29,What‚Äôs he saying?,True,1,0,germany,england,100,1369
29,Lol,True,1,0,england,germany,101,1370
29,So that‚Äôs why I feel like we need to make this deal.,True,1,0,germany,england,102,1371
29,But perhaps we can be even more clever.,True,1,0,germany,england,103,1372
29,He‚Äôs saying that I need to work with France to make sure you don‚Äôt get too strong,NOANNOTATION,0,0,england,germany,104,1373
29,Basically we have to agree on a strong alliance first,True,1,0,germany,england,106,1375
29,Before we can start playing 4d chess,True,1,0,germany,england,107,1376
29,"Italy is a nice guy, but as far as I see he is going to be an Austria puppet.",True,1,0,germany,england,108,1377
29,You know I‚Äôm all in on it,True,1,0,england,germany,109,1378
29,I agree,True,1,0,england,germany,110,1379
29,Hell yeah,True,1,0,germany,england,111,1380
29,"I think a simple move is to string Austria along as long as possible, without raising suspicions of an Anglo-German alliance.",True,1,0,germany,england,112,1381
29,This way we can get as much intel we can,True,1,0,germany,england,113,1382
29,"I think I can say I took sweden instead of the North Sea because I wanted another build, maybe he‚Äôll think I‚Äôm a noob, I don‚Äôt know any better, and will only be moderately suspicious",True,1,0,germany,england,114,1383
29,But how do I know you‚Äôre actually in and not just playing me?,True,1,0,germany,england,115,1384
29,Hello? I‚Äôm already nervous you‚Äôre like reporting all this to Austria haha,True,1,0,germany,england,116,1390

29,Of course bro.,True,1,0,germany,england,123,1398
29,Let‚Äôs take down Austria. I‚Äôm gonna tell Italy that we are iffy and have some trouble in case he‚Äôs reporting to Austria,True,1,0,england,germany,124,1399
29,"Basically just to be clear, I see this as a long term alliance to stop Austria. From my POV, it‚Äôs not about me or you winning ourselves but about having someone other than this top ranked player beat all of us.",True,1,0,germany,england,125,1400
29,Hell yeah.,True,1,0,germany,england,126,1401
29,100%,True,1,0,england,germany,127,1402

29,Hey man what‚Äôs going on with your supporting order into bur.,True,1,0,germany,england,131,1436
29,Complete oversight. I had my orders like that before we came to our agreement. Between talking to you and Italy and Austria AND my gf last night I forgot to change them up. My bad.,True,1,-2,england,germany,132,1472
29,That‚Äôs why there was a useless support of North Sea as well,True,1,-2,england,germany,133,1473
29,I should have moved London to the channel,True,1,-2,england,germany,134,1474
29,"Okay no worries at all. I‚Äôll take your word for it totally, but it kinda put me on alert that‚Äôs all.",True,1,2,germany,england,135,1515

29,Gonna need your help with nonaggression in the North Sea. Can you move your fleet to the Norwegian Sea next turn?,True,1,2,germany,england,144,1540

29,Do you think France will retreat to the North Sea if you take the channel???,True,1,2,germany,england,158,1629
29,That could fuck up everything,True,1,2,germany,england,159,1630
29,"Additionally, IF and only IF you feel comfortable with it, I‚Äôm happy to move my fleet into position to help you with the battle of the channel and to try to rout France from slipping into the Irish Sea or worse the Norwegian Sea.

29,Damn I wish we could call people rather than text but hey whatever,True,1,2,germany,england,162,1634
29,"It‚Äôs going to be hard to pull Italy away from Austria. We have to really strategize how we pull the ultimate stab. We should gently work on loosening Italy from Austria, but be prepared in case that doesn‚Äôt happen.",True,1,2,germany,england,163,1645
29,"Also no worries at all if not, but if you could support me into Paris that would be dope. No worries if you can‚Äôt at all!",True,1,2,germany,england,164,1655
29,"Let me know if you‚Äôre cool with me temporarily putting my fleet in ska in the North Sea to block off France. France retreating their will screw things up big time. I have it set to move there right now, but I‚Äôll call it off immediately if you tell me to.",True,1,2,germany,england,165,1657

33,Thoughts?,True,1,1,austria,england,53,1993
33,Interesting proposition. My biggest concern is that I‚Äôve left myself open to Germany in the north. Grabbing Warsaw would ensure that I lose Norway and he has a clear path to my island.,True,1,-1,england,austria,54,2002

So, yes, when I saw France pouring in from the West I was very open about how nervous England made me (about the same time I was screaming to you for help lol).   England has been very very keen for me to take on Turkey. Which I'd like to, and may mean he'll be attacking Russia then, when he's sure Turkey will be distracted from sharing in the centers.

43,Yeah I'd believe that. At least he was nice enough to explain things as he sees it.  If we're going to move on Turkey what would you think the best course of action is?

On the other hand that depends on us being able to trust what Russia is up to and frankly I‚Äôm not certain of him at all. I was committed to supporting A Ser into Bul this year in exchange for his support into Greece... but if we go back to the order log we can both see that didn‚Äôt happen.  What do you have in mind?

Those fleets were mainly meant to defend against a lepanto, and, fate willing, maybe seize the black sea that I naively ceded when I was young and trusting. Point is, they're not a threat to you especially since you're the only neighbor of mine willing to talk to me. They might even be useful for you in a few turns, if I'm still around.  I assume you want do dedicate your Nap fleet to snagging Tunis. And does the ""coastal waters"" thing mean you're concerned about the Adriatic? If not, then, what I hoped was that you might be willing to support Bul-Ser while stabbing Albania from the sea. This could set us up to start pushing back on Austria from the South.

I've just built a second fleet, but then I think I need that to escape my boot whichever way I'm going.   I am concerned about the Adriatic, but not sure I'm moving into it this year. I agree with your analysis of Bul (you're GOING to get hit) although it might be hard to bring up a new unit into Bul to replace your army there. Are you hoping to feed F Con to the east coast? You might need an Aegean fleet to force your way up, which should probably be yours unless  you're willing to extend me that much trust this early.

48,Agree,True,1,0,germany,austria,53,1076
48,If think you can handle England on the west you could probably book from Bal into Sweden and then they're cut off from the East. It would make it easier to clean up the eastern stragglers after.,True,1,0,austria,germany,54,1077

48,"Basically it seems like England is waiting for you and Italy to put a decent dent into Turkey before making any huge moves east, so you/we have time to nibble out turkey and build up in the meantime",True,1,2,germany,austria,68,1213
48,"It seems like Russia is going to support either England or Turkey into Moscow this season to leave the game with whoever his preference is at that supply center (just won't be me haha).  Would you feel ok moving an army to Uk r to support me into Moscow? Then I can support you into Sev or let you have Warsaw. And between Moscow and an army I'm moving up north this season, I can keep England at bay",True,1,2,germany,austria,70,1246

You dont have to just give it back, I can have my units take it  back in force so it looks like we are fighting. Although I do think you should start to deal with England considering how large they  are becoming.",True,1,-2,austria,germany,87,1515

48,"Ah makes sense. Yeah England is growing quickly. I‚Äôm trying to figure out the best way to settle things with France and England on my western border first, and then figure out the best way forward from there. I think England and Turkey will be tied up with each other to our East for a season or two which buys us some time",True,0,2,germany,austria,92,1566

50,Well I know this gonna sound a bit greedy right away but hear me out. If I get stp and you let me have Sweden you could have the rest of Russia and I believe that to be better because it keeps us with more clear defined borders.,False,1,0,england,germany,83,618

50,"As for Russia, I think I can agree with your proposal, but first I'd like to understand a little more how to see France working in all of this. France was originally on board with this alliance, but has been less vocal, so its hard for me to gauge his commitment level",True,1,0,germany,england,88,632
50,Right and based on the uncertainty we will have to act accordingly with him when the time comes,True,1,0,england,germany,89,636

50,Also france seeing my moves was real quick to jump on the opportunity he sees for himself and wants Munich,True,1,3,england,germany,116,812

50,Yeah good point,True,1,-1,germany,england,185,996

50,He's pretty tied up with Italy and Italy is tied up with him,True,1,-1,england,germany,229,1194
50,We could take him out or let him keep Italy in check but then again we could use Italy's help against Turkey,True,1,-1,england,germany,230,1195
50,"Yeah I'm not sure if it's better to cooperate with Italy and take out france, or just let the two of them fight it out a little longer.  I just wanted to check if you'd make any agreements recently to France",True,1,1,germany,england,231,1197
50,I haven't talked to him in a season or two,True,1,1,germany,england,232,1198

50,Nothing beyond that,True,1,-1,england,germany,234,1201
50,I'm inclined to just cooperate with Italy and take him out. That would be one less loose end. If we do that then we would have Italy's and Austria's help to eliminate Turkey,True,1,-1,england,germany,235,1203
50,Also in about one more year it will be time to start insinuating to Italy and Austria  that we will betray each other after turkey is gone,True,1,-1,england,germany,236,1206

50,I wouldn't mind sharing France with you though,True,1,-1,england,germany,243,1221
50,Besides I have 2 armies that I need to put to use in the east. I could get the far eastern fringe of Russia and you would be getting most of Austria.,True,1,-1,england,germany,244,1222

50,Ok that seems fair. I know we had talked about you just having StP when we originally discussed Russia. The only problem is that Austria is really worried about you at the moment and doesn't want to cooperate or make moves against Turkey when he sees you rolling down russia.,True,1,1,germany,england,247,1225
50,Italy is spooking everybody about me :/,True,1,-1,england,germany,248,1226

50,And yes I hear you about our original discussion although we can both testify that a lot has happened since then lol. Always hard to project a concrete future you know,True,1,-1,england,germany,250,1228
50,I think Austria just wants everyone else to stay put except him haha,True,1,1,germany,england,251,1229

50,"Hah yes, I understand too. I suppose I'm feeling a bit undecided on how to deal with Austria at the moment.",True,1,1,germany,england,255,1233
50,Tell you what. You take Moscow then and  I'll stay in the background like a lion ready to pounce at the right time. You get your leverage on Austria with that and in return you help me get Paris and bre.,True,1,-1,england,germany,256,1234

Normally when playing Russia I try to grab a couple German centers around 1904, allowing me to hold over the stalemate line setting up a solo when I conquer the East.

I don't expect other players to turn around and share my press with my opponents, because that strikes me as a poor way to demonstrate one's ability to keep quiet about things.

And I didn't think you were going to pounce on me from the start, I just see you as an ambitious player, and like I said,  having a strong Russian presence in the north from an ambitious player combined with a hostile England does not bode well for Germany unless Germany has already bolstered themselves in my past experience.",True,1,-1,germany,russia,18,154

If I have read that wrong then I apologize, but for those reasons I could not just go against Russia because in doing so I would cause a 3 on 1.

Moving on, which is all I've been trying to do, you need - at most - one more fleet in the south beyond your MAR, TYS, and TUN - which I assume will be your Fleet in LVP headed south.  That leaves your remaining seven units (didn't include the A PIE)  to hold Russia in check and take Scandinavia.

Right now you could stab me without any consequence to yourself, so I have to view me having Ven as a protection against that. You may have a different opinion, but I don‚Äôt see you as being in the same boat. Even if you vacate Tri and I take it (which I won‚Äôt) you would still get a build and I would end up being stuck fighting you without much momentum. So I propose that you move out of Tri first and when I see that you can‚Äôt take Ven, then I will move out of Ven.",True,1,0,italy,austria,16,348

148,What makes you worried about France?,True,1,-1,italy,austria,24,567

149,I‚Äôd personally favor Austria.,True,1,-1,italy,russia,2,38

149,You probably should. I've currently got a working relationship with the Germans but I'm thinking of upgrading it to a full-on alliance given the France-Britain alliance that's unfolding.,True,1,2,russia,italy,62,462

149,Not sure what we get from Germany on this other than that england and France don‚Äôt get too big too fast.,True,1,-2,italy,russia,66,466

149,I don‚Äôt know how much I can dedicate to both Turkey and France though. I‚Äôm assuming we will want both my fleets on Turkey.,True,1,-2,italy,russia,68,468

149,"Of course, Turkey needs to be destroyed ASAP, but even a slight distraction counts.",True,1,2,russia,italy,70,470

149,They are not a reliable communicator and my armies need to go somewhere,True,1,-2,italy,russia,73,473

149,"I'd already agreed to help them by taking Norway and deploying my fleets to fuck with the Brits, I figure that as long as we keep cooperating along those lines then that's effectively an alliance, no need to be all formal about it. The two of you should definitely start to closely cooperate though.",True,1,2,russia,italy,80,484
149,France made some interesting choices with that build. Normally building fleets in the north would be something that puts the British deeply on edge.,True,1,2,russia,italy,81,490

149,"Well, they can't kill the fleet in Belgium and keep Norway at the same time, but then again, if the Germans do as I asked they wouldn't be able to do either even if they prioritized Norway. Germany may not have the upper hand but they still have a decent position.",True,1,2,russia,italy,86,497
149,Yeah I‚Äôm gonna message england about that fleet in Bre and see what he says,True,1,-2,italy,russia,87,498
149,I think he anticipates me coming for Norway and that's the reason that he built a fleet in Edinburgh.,True,1,2,russia,italy,88,502
149,"Well we will see, if France moves that fleet in Spain back into the mid Atlantic (which would confuse me) things are gonna get messy.",True,1,-2,italy,russia,89,503
149,Maybe they figure that they can get to the British when they're out of position and grab up the majority of the supply centers before anyone can stop them?,True,1,2,russia,italy,90,504
149,"Yeah I really don‚Äôt know what people are thinking over there, I‚Äôve tried to get a feel for the alliances (even by offering to exchange info) but haven‚Äôt been able to crack them. According to germany, england was not supposed to do what they did (fairly obvious). It is possible that we have misread things though and england acted on their own. France did tell me they want to stay neutral until they trust someone. England sneak attacking Germany could have scared France, leading to the fleet build. This is obviously speculative though",True,1,-2,italy,russia,91,508
149,England slipped up with their language at one point and told me that they don't trust the French to *stay* allied with them if they don't keep them in check,True,1,2,russia,italy,92,510

149,Should I hold off on messaging France? Wouldn‚Äôt be the worst thing to make them think I‚Äôm oblivious.,True,1,-2,italy,russia,95,518
149,They started playing their cards very close to their chest with me though so I don't know if they trust me anymore. If you can get them off guard as far as your skill goes I can definitely see that going to your advantage.,True,1,2,russia,italy,96,520
149,I *definitely* don't like that the Austrians decided to build a fleet in Trieste. That doesn't indicate trust worthiness.,True,1,2,russia,italy,97,531
149,Any chance at least one of your armies will be heading down to keep Austria honest?,True,1,-2,italy,russia,98,533
149,I wish that I had the armies to spare but with the Brits displaying some amount of suspicion I don't know if I can afford to have any fewer than 3 units up there.,True,1,2,russia,italy,99,536

149,"That sounds great, I messaged Austria about going after Turkey, he said that he is interested but is more worried about France. That is reassuring to me though. Maybe you could reach out and try to figure out how we could do both?",True,1,-2,italy,russia,103,566
149,"There's not much I can do about France without dealing with the British first, but the best thing that we could do for the time being is see to it that the Turks are eliminated.  On that note, I'm working a deep subterfuge with the Turks.

I believe that they intend to move both fleets out at the same time, but I know for fact that they want to move into the Aegean with the fleet in Constantinople at the very least.

If the French back off we can easily get you Trieste and then start making serious gains on your front.  How's that sound as far as a general road map goes?

But anyways, the survival of your fleet in Belgium, at this point, depends on you either convincing the French not to block you out of either the English Channel or Piedmont, OR, using the fleet in Kiel to support an attack against the army in the Netherlands; the first isn't ideal because it's relying on the French, but the second isn't ideal because it's keeping Kiel stationary and thus blocking the exit of the Danish army, which is practically dead-weight where it is since it can't support to any of the sea-zones around it.   I'd move Munich to Ruhr and Berlin to Munich. Additionally, I would do the second option with your fleets whether or not you get an agreement from the French.

Even better though, if you make another move toward the North Sea, I can now *support* that move with Norway, meaning that unless the British successfully predict that, you are in position to take Edinburgh and threaten London unless they pull fleets back; if they pull fleets back, it takes pressure off of me and allows me to forward-deploy my own fleets, which are currently pinned down by British blockade.  Furthermore, you can move your fleet from the Helgoland Bight into Holland to take it, and use Kiel to support Munich to ensure Munich holds for long enough that the British have to disband. There are risks involved in the maneuver of course. The British could not only move themselves to Belgium, but they could move their fleet from the North Sea into Holland, bouncing you out and keeping all of their forces intact despite the loss of the North Sea.",True,1,1,russia,germany,51,770

154,"So I'll be supporting from Belgium to the North Sea then? There's a further significant risk that the British will use one of their fleets in the north to defeat Norway's support and thus keep the North Sea AND Netherlands AND take Belgium.  Personally, I actually am not a fan of the move. Too many risks to be realistically successful this turn, better saved until next year I think. You're better off using the Helgoland Bight to support Belgium in a retreat to Holland for the time being, and then perform this maneuver next year when your position is more solid and the British have lost a unit. If Munich weren't under enough risk that you could use Kiel to support into Holland as well it would be much more viable.

The biggest question here is Burgundy, which borders one of your home supply centers and two of mine. It is important to me that Burgundy remains unoccupied - my suggestion is that we set up a bounce between A Munich - Burgundy, A Paris - Burgundy. This has the secondary benefit of allowing us to put on some theater about how the other broke their word to win sympathy points. I also believe that Germany often wants A Munich to stay put anyways, to guard against an attack through Tyrolia.  Let me also know your thoughts regarding Belgium.

164,But why A London then?,True,1,-1,france,russia,98,628
164,"Yeah, it's not a terribly competent build order all things considered. The fact that in one turn Liverpool can move to be convoyed through any sea zone around Britain means that it's significantly better for that, London only makes sense as a sedentary defensive move.",True,1,1,russia,france,99,629
164,"I'm not sure it makes sense even as a defensive move. IN the event that I stab and go to the channel, they would likely be reluctant to use A London to bounce the convoy in Wales",True,1,-1,france,russia,100,632
164,"While it can obviously cover London itself, in that sense it is little better than Liverpool -> Yorkshire",True,1,-1,france,russia,101,633

164,"I suspect the thought process was more on the lines of initially wanting to build a fleet in London, deciding I would likely see that as an act of aggression, and changing it to an army",True,1,-1,france,russia,103,639
164,Perhaps? Seems like an error of not enough foresight if that's the case.,True,1,1,russia,france,104,642

164,Look on the bright side. Turkey seems firmly in your camp now. With their help Austria should be easy to manage,True,1,-1,france,russia,111,794
164,Not without losses unfortunately. You know it might be more easy for me to put a fleet in the Norwegian sea if you didn't put so much pressure on the Germans.,True,1,1,russia,france,112,797
164,What assistance would you need from Germany? A Denmark is probably at your disposal - it can do nothing useful in the west.

You have their trust, you can convince them that because I'm going to use all my resources to clamp down Norway, meaning that they cannot possibly take it, and that since the Germans are obviously going to support Munich with the army in Kiel that they cannot take it. Furthermore, ""you got the Germans to admit"" That they will only be coming to Netherlands with the fleet in Belgium + the fleet in the Helgoland Bight.  Thus you suggest that they do a supported move to the Netherlands using F North Sea and A Ruhr to block that, while you take Belgium.  This will fool them sufficiently that the Germans can use the army in Kiel to support the fleet in Belgium into the Netherlands as well as the fleet in the Bight, ceding Belgium to you in the process, while also freeing me of one necessary support so that I can move from Sweden to Skagerrak, and the British lose two of their units this build phase.

166,"I think it's already pretty clear that I trust you more than I trust Germany, just from the fact that I agreed to demilitarize the English Channel while we had an arranged bounce in Burgundy",True,1,0,france,england,24,329

166,"Indeed, congrats!",True,1,0,france,england,28,410
166,What's your plans for build? I was thinking of building A Marseilles to support myself into Burgundy and advance against Germany,True,1,0,france,england,29,411
166,"And then couple that with F Brest, which could go to Picardy to contest Belgium",True,1,0,france,england,30,412

166,Right. Hopefully you stick with the more competent player üòâ,True,1,0,england,france,32,439
166,"Honestly, I figured I should do my due diligence and consider it, but I can't figure out how a France-German alliance would even work in this situation. It's not as if he could support me into Belgium",True,1,0,france,england,33,443
166,U could tell him yes and then use that to stab,True,1,0,england,france,34,453
166,"I might do that, but he's in a tight defensive enough position as is",NOANNOTATION,0,0,france,england,35,454

166,Im thinking a build in london and a fleet in edinburg,True,1,0,england,france,37,456
166,"As in, army in London and fleet in Edinburgh?",True,1,0,france,england,38,457
166,yea,True,1,0,england,france,39,479
166,Makes sense!,True,1,0,france,england,40,480
166,"Frankly, I don't like your fleet in Bre. An army could have contested Belgium as well.",True,1,0,england,france,41,489
166,"If you move it to the english channel... I'm going to take that as on obvious sign of aggression, and cover London. If you move it to picardy, were all good.",True,1,0,england,france,42,491
166,"Lol both russia and Italy reached out to me asking if you had accidentally switched those builds... I agree with them, they do seem pretty strange",True,1,0,england,france,43,527
166,"Strange or not, I'm fairly sure I told you earlier that I was thinking of building a fleet and Brest and didn't get any objections",True,1,0,france,england,44,548
166,"But at any rate, I can promise you that it will be going to Picardy rather than to the Channel. If it does go to the Channel, you should see that as an act of aggression on my part",True,1,0,france,england,45,549
166,"So, I've heard that you told Italy I'm planning to attack them with the fleet in Spain?",True,1,0,france,england,46,580
166,Never said that...,True,0,0,england,france,47,581
166,"Interesting. Well, anyways that's not important. I'd like to apologise again for building the fleet in Brest without proper consultation - I assumed that you saw the message and were okay with it",True,1,0,france,england,48,582
166,I will move to Picardy and continue our demilitarization of the English Channel. Hopefully we can put this behind us and focus on Germany,True,1,0,france,england,49,583
166,Nice,True,1,0,england,france,50,584

166,Good.,True,1,0,england,france,52,586

166,Yes. Like the first turn...,True,1,0,england,france,57,594
166,One other thing to check - would you be comfortable with me sending F Spain to Mid Atlantic in order to get A Portugal out?,True,1,0,france,england,58,601
166,Plan is to return to Spain afterwards,True,1,0,france,england,59,602

166,"Attacking Germany is the priority in my mind, especially since A Marseilles is needed on that front",True,1,0,france,england,61,722
166,Can consider how best to attack Italy if/when Germany is dealt with,True,1,0,france,england,62,723
166,On that note - we now have a very messy map. Let me put some thoughts on how to proceed,True,1,0,france,england,63,724
166,"Okay, retaking Norway is probably a lost cause, given that Russia tends to be a conservative player, and such a player will probably be very tempted to just do:  F Sweden & A StP S F Nwy H",True,1,0,france,england,64,813
166,"I will do A Burgundy S F PIcardy - Belgium, which will cut support",True,1,0,france,england,65,814
166,F Nth S A Ruhr - Holland should then be able to hold Holland,True,1,0,france,england,66,815
166,"Ok, I'm here now",True,1,0,england,france,68,1013
166,"It's late at night for me, so I might not stay up too long, but what do you think of the suggestion?",True,1,0,france,england,69,1016
166,"I seriously doubt I can get Norway back. My moves last turn were... well... risky. I asked if there was anything I could do for them to get Norway back, but I seriously doubt it. Belgium is guaranteed for you. The thing is, I'm not sure I can get Holland. Germany probably anticipates you taking Belgium, and will move into Holland with Belgium, and with support, their going to get it.",True,1,0,england,france,70,1019
166,"Which means I'm at 3 centers, and won't have a chance of getting denmark.",True,1,0,england,france,71,1020
166,Thinking out loud here - if we assume Germany will anticipate that I attack Belgium and order A Kiel & F HEL S F Bel - Hol,True,1,0,france,england,72,1025
166,Munich would be vulnerable,True,1,0,france,england,73,1026
166,"Would you be comfortable with F NTH S F Pic - Bel, A Ruh S A Bur - Mun?   From there, I can support you into Kiel and/or Holland",True,1,0,france,england,74,1027
166,I'm hearing you ask me to support you twice this turn. If I do this I will almost undoubtedly lose two centers. I will be at 3. You will be at 7.,True,1,0,england,france,75,1029
166,"it's simply not fair. I support you into Belgium, you support me into Munich",True,1,0,england,france,76,1030
166,"Just so you know, it's like 2am in my time zone, so if I don't hear back before I go to bed I'm just going to support myself into Belgium. Don't want to risk losing a build to miscommunication, so would just take the guaranteed option in that case",True,1,0,france,england,80,1048
166,"Ok, I'd like to work things out",True,1,0,england,france,81,1052
166,Let's do that. How much longer are you here?,True,1,0,england,france,82,1053
166,I'll probably go to bed after we finish this conversation,True,1,0,france,england,83,1054
166,"Ok. I was thinking... do you want to have Munich and I get Belgium? May require a bit of trust, but I am full in for this alliance. Also Munich is better for you to have then me",True,1,0,england,france,84,1055
166,"I actually thought about that, but it's considerably riskier. A Ruhr is decently likely to have its support cut, while it's impossible for that to happen to A Munich",True,1,0,france,england,85,1057
166,"Ok, but I seriously doubt Ruhr will have it's support cut.",True,1,0,england,france,86,1059
166,"Odds are low, but it's possible if Germany things you want to backfill to NTH",True,1,0,france,england,87,1062
166,"But yeah, I'm comfortable with betting that Germany won't do that",True,1,0,france,england,88,1063
166,And also with trusting that your support will materialize,True,1,0,france,england,89,1064
166,"So that would suggest F Picardy S F NTH - Bel, A Bur - Mun?",True,1,0,france,england,90,1065
166,"So... which option? I think we can bet that germany won't do that. I think it is definitely the better move. It's just up to how much you trust me. Again, I'm ready to go all the way with this alliance. I think I might diplomatically have Russia in the bag, and be able to Norway back, from which I could get Stp. With me going for russia, and maybe eventually italy, I think we can get a two way win.",True,0,0,england,france,91,1068
166,"With Munich under my control, attacking Italy or even Austria becomes much more feasible - we would definitely be on track for a two way win, especially with the eastern triangle going nowhere",True,1,0,france,england,92,1070
166,"Provided you agree, I'm prepared to commit to:  A Ruhr S A Bur - Mun  F Pic S F NTH - Bel",True,1,0,france,england,93,1072
166,Just to check though - what are you possibly offering Russia that makes them voluntarily return Norway?,True,1,0,france,england,94,1074
166,That sounds good.,True,1,0,england,france,95,1075
166,I'm offering them support into Denmark,True,1,0,england,france,96,1076

166,Haha it's only marginally worse than giving up Norway,True,1,0,france,england,101,1086
166,"Ok, sounds good. SLeep well",True,1,0,england,france,102,1093

Typically as Austria my thoughts are to keep Russia and Turkey from allying, and pick one side against the other.  If you wanted to go after Turkey with me, that could work, but if you wanted to go after France (with either English or German help), I could go after Russia with Turkish help.

174,Italy seems committed to avoiding Tyr. Do you have any interest in working with them against Turkey?,True,1,0,germany,austria,7,123

174,"If you want to move Mun, you can always move it back there in the Fall in case Italy lied, so if I were you I‚Äôd make better use of it: I like Mun-Ruh in Spring 01: you have a say in who gets Bel, or you can guarantee Hol, and you‚Äôre still right next to Mun in case Italy is in TRL or France goes to Bur.",True,1,0,austria,germany,10,129

I can probably be fine either way, but would like to have some idea which to plan for...",True,1,0,austria,germany,16,224
174,Where did you hear about France‚Äôs move?,True,1,0,germany,austria,19,227
174,"France told me directly that they were moving back away from Venice.  I don't see any reason why they'd lie to me about that, since I'm the one who could help them right now if they asked (and if I wanted to, which I don't, but they didn't even ask).",True,1,0,austria,germany,20,228

174,Right. So do you know if Italy is aware of France pulling back?,True,1,0,germany,austria,22,230
174,"Italy asked me if it was ok if they hung around in Venice for now, to watch and see if France really did pull away.  I told them of course it was ok, and that I appreciated them letting me know they'd still be sitting right next to Trieste.  So I think Italy and I are at least being pretty up front about what we're doing.

174,"Cool.  I don't see how France has much to offer you at this point (support into Belgium, I guess?), but I can see the appeal of Burgundy - France kinda collapses if they lose that line, but once they've picked up builds from Spain + Portugal, it gets wayyyy harder.",True,1,0,austria,germany,25,236
174,Absolutely. They can‚Äôt get both builds in Iberia that soon because of their current locations. But I also don‚Äôt want England to stab me in the process either.,True,1,0,germany,austria,26,247
174,"England seems like an aggressive player, but a good one, and IMO, a good player in England‚Äôs position has far more to gain by a concerted attack *with* you against France than just stabbing you with no clear help.

174,"Turkey says they messed up the ""submit"" button somehow (it's easy to do, actually - very frustrating when you don't verify that they're really submitted), so held by accident.  But it basically means they're kinda toast at this point - I'll probably go with Russia and Italy against them at least for a short time.",True,1,0,austria,germany,33,293
174,That‚Äôs too bad. Leaves them a sitting duck.,True,1,0,germany,austria,34,294
174,"However, once you've subdued France a bit, and I've shrunk Turkey down to a manageable size, I think *then* is the right time to focus our combine attention on Russia.  In the meantime, you and England should definitely make sure to keep them contained in the north.",True,1,0,austria,germany,35,295
174,"Speaking of England, one thing annoying about E/G alliances is that you really only have this one chance to build a fleet without signalling your change of intentions too obviously: now.  Right now, a Fleet Berlin build does not scare/worry your English ally, because it's clearly meant to pin down scandanavia (F Den S Ber-Bal, next season, F Bal S Den-Swe, and you work with England to support them into StP).  Any build of a fleet later is clearly meant to attack England, and they see it coming.  It's almost as obvious a telegraphed signal as Austria building a fleet (I could *tell* Italy that I'll use it against Turkey, but they'd have to be pretty dumb to believe that!)",True,1,0,austria,germany,36,296
174,Yeah good points. I‚Äôll see what I can do.,True,1,0,germany,austria,37,297
174,"For what it's worth: if you and England go after Swe + Stp, I don't really see Russia trying to retaliate on land: that stretches them super wide and thin, with some armies in the south fighting Turkey, and some against you, and a big gaping hole in the middle... where I sit with a pile of armies.  So if they're sensible, they'll just grumble loudly and ignore the loss in the north, biding their time to strike back once Turkey's subdued and they hope they can trust me to join them against you.  It's all in the timing, though!  I'd certainly not prefer it, but you could play nice with them, hoping you can work with them against *me* in the mid-game.  But I'm going to hope you don't go that way, because doing that just leaves your back wide open to English perfidy. üôÇ",True,1,0,austria,germany,38,300

174,"Yep, I'm right there with you. Let's keep watch, and if my working with them means that they end up getting a build from Turkey (likely, esp. if Turkey keeps messing up like this past season), I'll let you know in advance so that perhaps that's a time when you and England can make sure the lose one in the north at the same time to stay ""thin enough"" üôÇ",True,1,0,austria,germany,40,302

174,Going pretty good. Looks like it for you too. I think Italy is coming in to get their piece of France before it‚Äôs all gone. We‚Äôll see how it gets divided. Yeah especially with England‚Äôs fleets up north.,True,1,0,germany,austria,42,381

174,"Understood.  Hopefully we can make that well coordinated (I‚Äôll have to know I‚Äôm safe to turn my back on Italy).  I doubt you‚Äôll get a chance to build another fleet without signaling a stab, frankly.  If/when you do it, it‚Äôll probably need to be a ‚Äúfall turn stab for Bel or Nwy or Bre, build a fleet with that build‚Äù kind of stab.  No England with a brain would look at a German ally building a third fleet as any ally worth keeping around.",True,1,0,austria,germany,46,392
174,Yeah I get that. Now it‚Äôs just a matter of timing it between who else I‚Äôm attacking and when a stab is available. Don‚Äôt want to overextend myself and end up trapped by England and whoever else we were just working against.,True,1,0,germany,austria,47,393

I asked you last season what the coordinated plan was, but you either didn‚Äôt want to share or needed to go it alone at first, which is fine, but if we want to avoid slowing each other down, we need to talk about it, even if we‚Äôre not attacking the same person at the same time, you know?",True,1,0,austria,germany,54,568

182,Hey there - any chance you can use Munich to hit Berlin?  You could cut a support so that Russia and I could crush one of their units and press up to the German border more...,True,1,5,austria,france,26,632
182,"Sure, I will do that",True,1,-5,france,austria,27,651
182,"I wasn't expecting Germany to throw their entire armed forces at just retaking Munich, but I'm kinda glad they did: they crumbled their entire defenses doing so.  Might as well keep the fleet in Mar, it's possible with Italy's position we can even keep you alive in there!",True,1,5,austria,france,28,687
182,Well I did my best here,True,1,-5,france,austria,29,691
182,Surviving a concerted 2:1 this long is no small feat!  Wish I could‚Äôve been able to help sooner.  For what it‚Äôs worth I‚Äôm not attacking Italy for now so that they can continue to work together with you to hold E/G off,True,1,5,austria,france,30,692
182,"Thanks, I have tried my best to break that alliance but to no avail. I do understand that you as Austria and Italy won't be interested in fighting Germany in early game. No hard feelings against anyone, but I do feel like revenging on Germany or England in any way possible.",True,1,-5,france,austria,31,693
183,"Hey Russia, would you be open to not moving an army north? I‚Äôm not interested in taking StP",True,1,-1,england,russia,0,2
183,Austria is pushing Italy to not do a lepanto but to go west. That might mean that Turkey is going north with Austria.,True,1,-1,england,russia,1,46
183,"Thanks for the info! I trust that you  don‚Äôt want to take StP, an army north could help me put you into Norway though",True,1,1,russia,england,2,70
183,I‚Äôll be ok in Norway without your army in StP. I view A Mos - StP in spring 1901 as a strong anti-England move and building F StP(nc) as equally anti-England,True,1,-1,england,russia,3,86
183,"Are we still good up north? I‚Äôm not interested in fighting you right now, and would prefer to just use a fleet to capture Nrwy.  Can you promise to not send Mos northward this turn?",True,1,-1,england,russia,4,143
183,"Of course, I wasn't trying to be  sneaky with my suggestion. I understand your concern and will not move StP North.",True,1,1,russia,england,5,146
183,Have you ever considered letting Germany move into Swe and going south to the Baltic? It‚Äôs a gamble that could hurt/benefit either of you. Germany gets one center either way.,False,1,-1,england,russia,6,170

183,Ha already on it XD. You and Germany planning on crushing him quickly?,True,1,1,russia,england,9,185
183,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be quick by any means. I‚Äôm worried about Germany running away with it in ‚Äò03 and want to make sure we grow at the same rate so that there isn‚Äôt another stab. I‚Äôm not a fan of chaotic variation in country strength,False,1,-1,england,russia,10,187

183,Sorry. I didn‚Äôt see your message.,True,1,0,england,russia,14,330
183,"My builds are not north focused. I‚Äôm moving F Nrwy - NwgS to help you out.  Germany is ordering A Hol - Kie, so I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be able to push Mun or Ber. Your best bet might be to bounce him in Bal",True,1,0,england,russia,15,331
183,Would you consider giving me Sweden instead of moving fleet out?,True,1,0,russia,england,16,348
183,"Unfortunately, I cannot support you against Germany at this time. France is teetering but not gone, and I do not have an army large enough to launch an invasion of Germany.  I hope that sticking to my word in Norway and my forthrightness with intelligence will be enough to continue our amicable relationship?  Turkey is trapped in the south with that odd A Smy build, but, on the plus side, that strategic limitation opens up a Russo Turkish alliance that is far less threatening than a normal juggernaut.  Maybe you could offer Swe to Germany in exchange for you and I destroying one of his two fleets? I‚Äôd prefer to not offer the idea on my own. Also, if he does not pass it along to me, that will tell us both a great deal about his naval and northern ambitions.",True,1,0,england,russia,17,354
183,"Ok I understand, and yes I still consider us on good terms. How does the destroy German fleet trade work again?",True,1,0,russia,england,18,356
183,"Say that you can cede Swe but two German fleets on the Baltic represent ongoing threat to StP. You can ask him if he is open to destroying his second fleet in 1903.  If Germany is open to that, the only way I see it happening is if I support you into Swe in spring 1903, he destroys, and then I support him back into Swe in fall 1903.",True,1,0,england,russia,19,359
183,Im assuming its an all out attack on france kind of turn?,True,1,-1,russia,england,20,494

183,I don‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs attacking you. Self bouncing up there delays his attack into StP.  What‚Äôs the Italian intelligence,True,1,1,england,russia,23,515
183,"Not sure what the Italian is scheming. They told me they were going lepanto, but I haven't been negotiating with them much.",True,0,-1,russia,england,24,518
183,"Sorry I failed to tip you off about Italy moving west, I second guessed telling you bc I wasn't sure it was accurate. Do you think that will be harmful to you? Or can you use the italians to help finish off france? It looks like you have Spain in the bag, but mar and par might be a little more challenging. What do you have planned for the fleet heading north?",True,1,-1,russia,england,25,525
183,The Italians can‚Äôt help me.  It is just sitting there. It‚Äôs meant to not threaten Swe and to hold Nth,True,1,1,england,russia,26,532
183,What's the play in 1904? Are you threatening Denmark?,True,1,1,russia,england,27,579

183,"I want to believe you, but you‚Äôre working with Austria to cross the stalemate line. If I stabbed Germany, I‚Äôd be sealing my own fate. You‚Äôd be able to roll him up and I couldn‚Äôt hold you and Italy off.",True,1,0,england,russia,35,721

184,"Oh sorry missed the msg to move out of bl sea ill do that this turn. I did bring my army down into Armenia, To help you expel the Italian. It looks like Austria and Italy are working together.
