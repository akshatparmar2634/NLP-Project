0,"Good afternoon to our friends in the south, just sending this message to open a channel for future relations when ever they need to happen, and to say 'howdy and have a good game' to you.",True,1,0,germany,italy,0,6
0,"Of course! I thank you very much. The future of the Kaissereich and its effect on my neighbors will be very important to me, so tell me if you want help to dissuade attack.",True,1,0,italy,germany,1,11
0,"Well, should the French turn out to be a thorn in my side I would greatly appreciate the aid",True,1,0,germany,italy,2,14
0,Greetings from new Italy!,True,1,0,italy,germany,3,96
0,"Would just like to reiterate that Italy would likely take an opportunistic stance towards France - their defensive position is strong enough that I won't attack them proactively, but if they are locked into a conflict with you I might stab them",True,1,0,italy,germany,4,97
0,"So in that sense Italy is broadly friendly to your interests - if you and France are allied I will leave you alone, but if France is your enemy I could potentially help you to break a stalemate",True,1,0,italy,germany,5,98
0,"But what I'd need in exchange is for you to keep me posted on developments in the west. Are you leaning towards working with England, or France?",True,1,0,italy,germany,6,99
0,"It seems for the moment that both are cooperative, but I'm likely to side with the French from the outset barring difficulties with them. I'll keep you posted, same relationship as previously established. In any case, friendship with the French is not very likely to last past England's demise so I'll definitely need the help then. Thank!",True,1,0,germany,italy,7,106
0,"Makes sense. Hopefully I'll be on the winning side of a conflict against Turkey or Austria by then, which should put us in position to squeeze France",True,1,0,italy,germany,8,121
0,"I'd greatly prefer you end up on Austria's side of that conflict all things considered, but if things don't go his way I wouldn't blame you for siding against them.",True,1,0,germany,italy,9,133
0,"Definitely understandable. But since Italy starts off as one of the weaker countries, I basically need to play a little opportunistically",True,1,0,italy,germany,10,137
0,The elephant in the room is Russia - would you have any insight on what they're planning?,True,1,0,italy,germany,11,138
0,Unfortunately we only talked very briefly about staying out of each other's ways.,True,1,0,germany,italy,12,139
0,Haha didn't try to hold Sweden hostage to get him to play nice with Austria? That's my usual go-to as Germany lol,True,1,0,italy,germany,13,140
0,Have you talked more with Austria? I must admit to being concerned about you moving to Tyrolia in their defense,True,1,0,italy,germany,14,141
0,Since that would allow the two of you to launch a pretty credible attack on Venetia,True,1,0,italy,germany,15,142
0,"As Germany I generally play somewhat more careful, get them to just promise not to be an enemy until the Western Triple becomes a Western Double. As far as Austria goes, we're allied, hence my preference for Turkey being your foe rather than them. I've no intent of turning South though, not by any means. Don't have the pieces for that.",True,1,0,germany,italy,16,143
0,"Yeah, fair enough. I'm planning on a pretty standard opening to Ionian Sea, aiming to convoy to Tunis and with a bounce in Austria",True,1,0,italy,germany,17,145
0,"It's a pretty noncommittal move, so will wait and see how things play out",True,1,0,italy,germany,18,146
0,But I'm sure nobody will miss the fact that it sets me up for the Lepanto if the cards fall that wau,True,1,0,italy,germany,19,147
0,"Well the Lepanto setup is generally considered Italy's best opener, regardless of whether they trust Austria, hard to argue with a classic.",True,1,0,germany,italy,20,148
0,It's looking like the Russians and the Turks are trying a Juggernaut.,True,1,0,germany,italy,21,166
0,"If they do that, we desperately need to be strongly allied with the Austrians, otherwise they'll roll us over, hard.",True,1,0,germany,italy,22,180
0,"I am also concerned about the Juggernaut, which pushes me towards you and Austria's camp",True,1,0,italy,germany,23,194
0,"It seems France and England are at a loggerhead already, so if you side with England it might be an opportunity for me as well",True,1,0,italy,germany,24,195
0,"Our interests are aligned in both sides of the map, so let's just coordinate closely",True,1,0,italy,germany,25,196
0,I'd be more comfortable committing both fleets east to support Austria against Turkey if I knew you were going to Burgundy (which makes it harder for France to convoy to Tuscany),True,1,-1,italy,germany,26,384
0,France's F Marseille is a major headache for me,True,1,-1,italy,germany,27,385
0,What say you?,True,1,-1,italy,germany,28,386
0,"France is definitely going to be a thorn in your side, unfortunately I can neither afford to attack them right now nor likely convince them to not attack you, they're more powerful than I am and I've already pissed off two of my three potentially unfriendly neighbors.",True,1,1,germany,italy,29,424
0,"The Balkan Front is pretty secure for you two though, you can at least hold and with some tricky maneuvering, very easily begin advancing through the Turks.",True,1,1,germany,italy,30,425
0,Understood. Know that Austria and Italy are not going to be able to hold out against Russia and Turkey,True,1,-1,italy,germany,31,489
0,"If you want to prevent a juggernaut, we will need whatever help from you we can get",True,1,-1,italy,germany,32,490
0,"Well, as I'm sure you've noticed, I've mobilized for the task.",True,1,1,germany,italy,33,494
0,"I've talked to the French to try and get them off your back, but they're dedicated to seeing you off. They told me to tell you that they plan to attack Piedmont with support, which indicates that they're probably planning a convoy to Tuscany. You can't let that happen.",True,1,1,germany,italy,34,566
0,"Well, it seems the attack on Piedmont with support was genuine, which seems like a very poor decision by the French",True,1,0,italy,germany,35,683
0,"Yeah, maybe they predicted that you'd think they were lying to me? Regardless, bad move on their part in any case, especially since you have a build.",True,1,0,germany,italy,36,684
0,"Good news for you though. A distracted France is still more than enough firepower to get you through England, and it makes it easy for you to stab them after",True,1,0,italy,germany,37,685
0,"I don't know whether you deliberately leaked me that intel thinking I would disbelieve it and go to Tuscany, but no hard feeling if so",True,1,0,italy,germany,38,686
0,That's jsut well played,True,1,0,italy,germany,39,687
0,"It certainly does, I wish they'd let you get on with destroying the Turks so you could focus fire on them when it's needed but still. And I gave you that information because I genuinely thought that their objective would be to get you to expect what they told me to tell you so they could do something else. Was worried that they'd do the convoy because that would be devastating for you.",True,1,0,germany,italy,40,688
0,"Haha honestly that risk was very top of mind for me, since I attempted the same convoy as France in the previous game",True,1,0,italy,germany,41,689
0,So would likely have made the risk averse move to avoid the convoy even without the warning,True,1,0,italy,germany,42,690
0,"Yeah, it's a real power-move as the French to pull off that convoy.",True,1,0,germany,italy,43,693
0,"Well, it didn't work for me either",True,1,0,italy,germany,44,694
0,"Well, experienced Italys generally see it coming.",True,1,0,germany,italy,45,695
0,Indeed.,True,1,0,italy,germany,46,702
0,"I'm trying to do damage control with the Austrians. It was incredibly damaging for them to do that and I can't imagine why they've decided to side with the Turks rather than you. If it doesn't work out, I'm going to go nuclear and split them lengthways with the Turks.",True,1,0,germany,italy,47,809
0,I was taken very surprised in large part because I didn't see - and still don't see - what they stand to gain,True,1,0,italy,germany,48,813
0,"And if they really stand to gain ground, why not make a play for Venice?",True,1,0,italy,germany,49,814
0,"No idea, the y apparently aren't interested in working with you anymore. I'm quite frankly pulling my hair over this, it's the worst possible move.",True,1,0,germany,italy,50,815
0,"I find myself very confused by it as well, which is part of why I am not quite sure how to respond",True,1,0,italy,germany,51,847
0,Would you be willing to coordinate against A Tyrolia? I'd be happy to support A Munich in,True,1,-3,italy,germany,52,926
0,"I'm afraid that if I do that, my current position could quickly become untenable. I'm worried that the Austrians are planning something funky.",True,1,3,germany,italy,53,927
0,"Alright, so, I realize that this is a little bit late, but now that the Austrians are embroiled with the Turks, I am moving against the French. I'm trying to convince the Austrians that its in their best interests to join back with you, but I would understand if you might resent him or both of us for our failure to consistently side with you.",True,1,3,germany,italy,54,971
0,You stabbing the French is already a massive lifeline to me. I could not in good conscious ask you to do more,True,1,-6,italy,germany,55,1007
0,"I will listen to what Austria has to say, and keep you updated on that front. I do not really trust them, but I may still be willing to work with them against the Turks if they say the right things",True,1,-6,italy,germany,56,1008
0,"I'm moving on the French this next season, hopefully they'll pull back to face me and you and the British will be able to surge back against them.",True,1,6,germany,italy,57,1013
0,I'm pleasantly surprised that you're so willing to work with England as well,True,1,-6,italy,germany,58,1016
0,In that case i'll play defensively but try to set myself up for a counteroffensive,True,1,-6,italy,germany,59,1017
0,"Well the English are a little miffed that I didn't move last season, but still, I see no reason not to work with them for the time being.",True,1,6,germany,italy,60,1018
0,"Yeah, agreed. The English are too desperate to turn down your support",True,1,-6,italy,germany,61,1090
0,"Conversely, you have a free walk into Paris right now",True,1,-6,italy,germany,62,1091
0,Since France has only fleets,True,1,-6,italy,germany,63,1092
0,"A Mun - Bur and then to Paris is guarrenteed to succeed as long as you can cover a potential stab on Mun, which you could easily do with A Ber",True,1,-6,italy,germany,64,1093
0,"And then A Hol-Bel isn't quite as foolproof, but is pretty safe as well",True,1,-6,italy,germany,65,1094
0,Especially if you support yourself into NTH and move Kie - Hol,True,1,-6,italy,germany,66,1095
0,"If you're wondering who convinced the French to make it a fleet, you need go no further",True,1,6,germany,italy,67,1096
0,"Well, sounds like things are in good shape!",True,1,-6,italy,germany,68,1097
0,Hopefully the French are sufficiently distracted that you can launch a counter attack.,True,1,6,germany,italy,69,1150
0,"Yeah, I'll make the most of this",True,1,-6,italy,germany,70,1160
0,"The Austrians wouldn't happen to be talking about me, would they?",True,1,8,germany,italy,71,1177
0,I haven't heard anything from them,True,1,-8,italy,germany,72,1181
0,"Well, at the very least that's good. I'm worried about them potentially deciding that they want Warsaw, despite the fact that I'm on the right side of a stalemate line where they'd only get 1 supply center if they attacked.",True,1,8,germany,italy,73,1183
0,Are you coordinating with the Turks? I think that for the time being that would be a good idea.,True,1,8,germany,italy,74,1208
0,"Yeah, am trying to do so",True,1,-8,italy,germany,75,1231
0,I will make a play for Venice this Fall,True,1,-8,italy,germany,77,1277
0,"If I was in Austria's shoes, I would do a self bounce of F Ven - Tri, A Ser - Tri",True,1,-8,italy,germany,78,1278
0,"So I plan to do F Alb S F Ven - Tri, A Apu - Ven",True,1,-8,italy,germany,79,1279
0,Odds of succeeding in this improve dramatically if also support with A Tyr S A Apu - Ven - would you be willing to do so?,True,1,-8,italy,germany,80,1280
0,"Gas and Bur likely cannot take Mar anyways, so in my view you would be better off using: A Par & A Pic S A Gas - Bre F NTH S F Bel - ENG A Bur - Mun",True,1,-8,italy,germany,81,1281
0,"This would be a near-guarantee that you take Brest and would occupy F ENG as a consolation prize in the only outcome where you didn't, while still covering Munich",True,1,-8,italy,germany,82,1282
0,"My only problem with that plan is that it risks losing Burgundy if the French pull a fast one and go for Silesia instead, while moving Marseilles into Burgundy.",True,1,8,germany,italy,83,1288
0,That's a valid point. My view is that A Mar - Bur is unlikely but A Boh - Sil is a real risk,True,1,-8,italy,germany,84,1291
0,"If you want to keep France out of Bohemia, A Gal is the only unit you have that can do so",True,1,-8,italy,germany,85,1292
0,Which might be a better investment that using it to try and snipe Bud,True,1,-8,italy,germany,86,1293
0,"Although actually, if you hit Vienna and France has two disbands, they may struggle to keep up the pressure around Silesia",True,1,-8,italy,germany,87,1294
0,"That's true, I don't know if I want to take my chances with that though.",True,1,8,germany,italy,88,1298
0,"I'll probably move into Vienna, but I'm not sure I can afford to move out of Burgundy.",True,1,8,germany,italy,89,1300
0,"Understood, So then you would use A Gal to cover Warsaw, A Bur to cover Munich, and then try to snipe Vienna with A Tyr?",True,1,-8,italy,germany,90,1301
0,Correct,True,1,8,germany,italy,91,1305
1,How’s it going Italy?,True,1,0,austria,italy,0,1
1,"Relatively well. I'm doing a small concert soon, so kind of nervous, honestly. How about you?",True,1,0,italy,austria,1,3
1,"I'm assuming we can both agree to a nonaggression pact, and that you too were told to Lepanto the Turks (though I'm not sure if its a good idea)?",True,1,0,italy,austria,2,32
1,"We're the only ones I trust to understand how unlikely a Solo is, and you seem interested in cooperation, so I'll honestly put all my chips under your bag and defend you until the end if you're willing to do the same with me.",True,1,0,italy,austria,3,34
1,"At the very least, we can give one hell of a ride.",True,1,0,italy,austria,4,38
1,"I haven’t been told to do a Lepanto yet, who said that? And yes I would like peace on our front, I could have a three front war at any time so it would be great if you and I did not fight. Where would you expand to then?",True,1,0,austria,italy,5,45
1,I will be moving into Ven with Tri (traditional Austrian opening) and fully understand that you would go Ven to Tri as a response so that we bounce. If you can come up with a good alternative then I am fine with that but I don’t see one.,True,1,0,austria,italy,6,78
1,"I am perfectly comfortable with a Ven-Tri bounce, so no need for further discussion on that point. Would like to suggest that we demilitarize Tyrolia, at least for year one as well",True,1,0,italy,austria,7,88
1,"Would like to get your thoughts on your other moves? Is A Budapest going to Serbia, and is A Vienna going to Galicia or allowing Russia in?",True,1,0,italy,austria,8,89
1,Okay the bounce sounds good. And I would love to demilitarize Tyr for this year and we can talk about it again then,True,1,0,austria,italy,9,100
1,Why do you need my moves?,True,1,0,austria,italy,10,101
1,"I think in general it pays to know as much as possible about what everyone is doing. Even if they lie, it helps you get an early picture on who is trustworthy :p",True,1,0,italy,austria,11,122
1,But I think the Austria Italy relationship is bigger than that,True,1,0,italy,austria,12,123
1,Austria and Italy are two countries which can easily fall into a mutually destructive war until they both get eaten by Turkey,True,1,0,italy,austria,13,124
1,"But it's also very hard for us to trust each other, since it's so easy to stab. That's a big part of what makes these two countries so challenging for a lot of players, right?",True,1,0,italy,austria,14,125
1,"In that sense, it helps for us to be open with each other. It's a very different game for me if Russia gets into Galicia early, putting them and Turkey in place to roll the map, compared to if you and Turkey push Russia out of Rumania in year one",True,1,0,italy,austria,15,126
1,"In that context, I'm pretty comfortable telling you that I don't plan to get greedy in year 1 - as long as I can secure Tunisia while keeping a secure defensive position, I'm happy",True,1,0,italy,austria,16,127
1,I 100% do not want to fight you. I agree that Austria Italy is a war that often happens but never really works out for either side. We would just stagnate until russia or turkey or both took us out.,True,1,0,austria,italy,17,167
1,On that note I have heard rumors that turkey and Russia are gonna go for a juggernaut. If that is the case I’d assume you would help me slow them down.,True,1,0,austria,italy,18,168
1,Probably don’t need to point this out but you allying with turkey would eventually lead to him attacking you unless you stabbed him first,True,1,0,austria,italy,19,170
1,"Definitely agree that, assuming we can trust each other, the Austria-Italy alliance tends to be more stable than the Austria-Turkey one",True,1,0,italy,austria,20,181
1,"Turkey and Russia bounced in the Black Sea, but that proves little since Juggernaut allies often go for that anyways",True,1,0,italy,austria,21,182
1,"Russia has committed pretty hard to the south, which is mildly concerning for both of us. In the event that the Juggernaut materializes however, my sense is that Germany would also be willing to support us",True,1,0,italy,austria,22,183
1,"I guess for this year, suggest that we do the Ven-Tri bounce again. I would suggest to keep Turkey out of Greece and use Vienna to defend against Russia.",True,1,0,italy,austria,23,184
1,I will convoy A Apulia to Tunisia,True,1,0,italy,austria,24,185
1,All sounds good to me,True,1,0,austria,italy,25,199
1,Have you talked to turkey much?,True,1,0,austria,italy,26,232
1,Not a whole lot. Their move to the Black Sea was news to me,True,1,0,italy,austria,27,314
1,So turkey went back on their deal with me and tried to let russia get rum while they snuck into Gre. Juggernaut confirmed,True,1,0,austria,italy,28,321
1,I’d like to propose that you and I go full alliance,True,1,0,austria,italy,29,322
1,"I'm game for the Lepanto, and it seems Germany is on board as well",True,1,0,italy,austria,30,338
1,"What does that look like in practice? Germany builds in Berlin, you in Budapest",True,1,0,italy,austria,31,339
1,And then hit Rumania in Spring?,True,1,0,italy,austria,32,340
1,Not positive what I would do yet but something along those lines. You would definitely build a fleet in Nap and then move ION to EAS,True,1,0,austria,italy,33,341
1,"France and Turkey are trying to get me to attack you, obviously I will not do that",True,1,0,austria,italy,34,358
1,"With the build in Marseilles, France's goals are quite transparent",True,1,0,italy,austria,35,363
1,Turkey will likely bounce me in EAS. Would you be willing to support me into Greece (via convoy)?,True,1,0,italy,austria,36,364
1,"From there, I can support you into Bulgaria",True,1,0,italy,austria,37,365
1,I’m willing to debate it but I had a different view on this turn. I figured he would bounce you in EAS but what if you went for AEG instead? Unless you’re worried about over extending yourself due to France. Because I trust you enough at this point to move Tri to Alb and then we will definitely be able to get Gre in the fall.,True,1,0,austria,italy,38,371
1,Which makes going to AEG/EAS a bit of an overstretch,True,1,0,italy,austria,39,377
1,If we can get Germany on board I'd feel a lot more comfortable with committing east,True,1,0,italy,austria,40,378
1,"Sorry, some connection issues on my end so messages sent out of order",True,1,0,italy,austria,41,379
1,"But basically I'm concerned about France's F Marseille, so a little nervous about committing both fleets east",True,1,0,italy,austria,42,380
1,But I think having Germany attack France would ease that,True,1,0,italy,austria,43,381
1,"So in theory if we could not get germany to attack France, what kind of attack would you be comfortable with us making",True,1,0,austria,italy,44,387
1,In which case convoying onto Greece is the best use of the fleet and army I'd have available,True,1,0,italy,austria,45,401
1,"Okay I will support that, can you move out of Ven?",True,1,0,austria,italy,46,403
1,So I am in a slightly sticky situation but I think I can get out of it. If I support you holding in Gre then would you move that fleet into EAS?,True,1,0,austria,italy,47,432
1,"Also Germany and France are allied, however Germany is also willing to help us out",True,1,0,austria,italy,48,435
1,Let me know what you’re thinking,True,1,0,austria,italy,49,480
1,"Germany and France allying is not ideal for me, but I feel confident in observing that Turkey and Russia are allied as well",True,1,0,italy,austria,50,486
1,So desperate times call for desperate measures - may need to do what needs to be done to stop the juggernaut,True,1,0,italy,austria,51,487
1,"Would appreciate you helping me to hold in Greece, and we'll need whatever help from Germany that we can get",True,1,0,italy,austria,52,488
1,"I can still support A Serbia - Buglaria as well, if that helps",True,1,0,italy,austria,53,491
1,"Look at the moves from last turn, turkey tried to support me attacking Russia. Why do you think they are still allied?",True,1,0,austria,italy,54,499
1,"To put it simply, I missed that. I find Backstabbr's map interface hard to read, and didn't see it in the list of orders",True,1,0,italy,austria,55,681
1,Which I will look at more carefully going forward,True,1,0,italy,austria,56,682
1,"I gotcha, so you are clearly going after Turkey right now but have to deal with France. What’re you thinking in regards to that whole situation. Because I have to figure out whether or not I can use turkey as a short term ally vs Russia",True,1,0,austria,italy,57,696
1,However I view you as my most important ally which is why I’m asking you about all this,True,1,0,austria,italy,58,697
1,"I have moved against Turkey, but I am willing to back down to focus on France",True,1,0,italy,austria,59,703
1,"If you would rather coordinate with Turkey against Russia, I'm open to the idea of a southern triple as Turkey suggested",True,1,0,italy,austria,60,704
1,I mean turkey knows that you and I are allied so I think that if you attack him then he will attack me. I don’t really wanna fight him and russia at the same time,True,1,0,austria,italy,61,706
1,Do you think you can gain supply centers vs France? I get that you need to expand somewhere,True,1,0,austria,italy,62,707
1,What’re you thinking for this season,True,1,0,austria,italy,63,718
1,"I most likely can't gain a supply center this year, but I should be able to gain ground as long as neither you nor Turkey stab me",True,1,0,italy,austria,64,738
1,My thinking is that I'll go with the conservative option,True,1,0,italy,austria,65,739
1,Which is:  F TYS S F Rome - Tus A Tus - Ven,True,1,0,italy,austria,66,740
1,And then withdraw F EAS - ION,True,1,0,italy,austria,67,741
1,Should put me in position to push through WES starting fall while covering all my bases defeinsively,True,1,0,italy,austria,68,742
1,That all seems logical,True,1,0,austria,italy,69,743
1,What are you thinking? F Alb S A Gre H would be appreciated in my perspective,True,1,0,italy,austria,70,744
1,"Neither of us have a good reason to stab you, we gotta focus on russia",True,0,0,austria,italy,71,745
1,"Yeah, naturally. I'm concerned about what Turkey will do once Russia is defeated, but that's a question for another day",True,1,0,italy,austria,72,746
1,"I’ll do that, it keeps turkey from snagging Gre",True,0,0,austria,italy,73,747
1,Do you have Germany on your side as well?,True,1,0,italy,austria,74,748
1,"So am I, I’d expect they go through me before they go through you. That is why I need you",True,0,0,austria,italy,75,749
1,"Turkey has Sev in their pocket, which might open up a path to Moscow",True,1,0,italy,austria,76,750
1,"For now, he supported me into War which is nice so I will keep working with them",True,1,0,austria,italy,77,751
1,But they might want it for themselves,True,1,0,italy,austria,78,752
1,That is true,True,1,0,austria,italy,79,753
1,Makes sense. Keep me posted,True,1,0,italy,austria,80,754

5,"So... I guess your new? What do you think about this game? The above might still apply, but I don't know because Turkey might change your mind",True,0,0,france,italy,3,68
5,Greetings. I'll talk to Turkey again and see if I think it seems true,True,1,0,italy,france,4,85
5,Agree that early fights between France and Italy are often a waste of time for both sides,True,1,0,italy,france,5,86
5,Suggest we demilitarize Piedmont and Gulf of Tyrolia. I won't be too happy if you move to Spain sc or build a fleet in Piedmont either,True,1,0,italy,france,6,87
5,"Of course, I don't think we should be fighting(at least this early in the game), and that it would be mutually unproductive. I agree with a DMZ in Piedmont and Gulf of Tyrolia, and we might as well extend it to Western Mediterranean and North Africa. But I hope you understand how unreasonable for you to expect me not to move the Spain, as it is a typical France acquisition. Also I can't build a fleet in Piedmont... Anyways, Good luck, and have fun!",True,1,0,france,italy,7,149
5,"Sorry, was in a rush to write these since I just entered the game",True,1,0,italy,france,8,186
5,Let me clarify that i have no issue with you moving to Spain - but I'm a bit uncomfortable with a Fleet in Spain SC,True,1,0,italy,france,9,187
5,I believe Spa NC is naturally yours and have no issue with you moving an army there either.,True,1,0,italy,france,10,188
5,"As to the Piemdont issue, I actually meant Marseilles",True,1,0,italy,france,11,189
5,"But yeah, I see that you have made an anti-England opening, so we should get along swimmingly",True,1,0,italy,france,12,190
5,Yes. Don't worry about a fleet in Spain.,True,1,0,france,italy,13,207
5,How is your relationship with Germany?,True,1,-2,italy,france,14,336
5,Pretty solid.,True,1,2,france,italy,15,351
5,What's with the fleet build in Marseilles?,True,1,-2,italy,france,16,419
5,This stand off in LYO/TYS is a waste of effort for both of us,True,1,-2,italy,france,17,492
5,We would mutually benefit from a de-escalation,True,1,-2,italy,france,18,493
5,"While that might be true, what would you suggest I do with Lyo now? If you have a good alternative I would be happy to take it, as I'm not super keen on attacking you anyways",True,0,2,france,italy,19,544
5,"I can support myself into piedmont and there is nothing stopping me. If you don't want me to, give me an alternative",True,1,2,france,italy,20,546
5,It is very poor faith of you to suggest that your hand was forced in your move to Piedmont. Nobody made you build a F in Marseille which can do nothing but attack me in the Mediterranean,True,1,-1,italy,france,21,673
5,You only managed to get into Piedmont because I was worried that you would attempt the more creative and threatening move of convoying into Tuscany,True,1,-1,italy,france,22,674
5,"Even now, those armies would be far better placed in Gascony, where they are better placed to convoy to England",True,1,-1,italy,france,23,675
5,"But to be blunt, I don't trust you enough to see much point in talking with you at length",True,1,-1,italy,france,24,676
5,Let's just see how far your army in Piedmont can get in the end,True,1,-1,italy,france,25,677
5,Austria's build in Trieste cannot be anything but a play for Venice,True,1,-5,italy,france,26,1011
5,I am willing to concede it to you if you cooperate elsewhere,True,0,-5,italy,france,27,1012
5,"Hmm. I messaged austria, and they didn't respond. What kind of cooperation elswhere do you want if you concede Venice>",True,0,5,france,italy,28,1023
5,"At this point, I'm at war on too many fronts, and I just need to ease the pressure",True,1,-5,italy,france,29,1086

5,"Hello, Italy???",True,1,5,france,italy,33,1149
5,??,True,1,5,france,italy,34,1153
5,Would you be willing to discuss terms regarding Venice?,True,1,-3,italy,france,38,1190
5,Jeezus,True,1,3,france,italy,39,1197
5,"You have a free path into Trieste right now, and from there you can pressure Vienna",True,1,-3,italy,france,40,1202
6,Seems the game has conspired to make us natural allies once again.,True,1,0,germany,austria,0,5
6,How’s that,True,1,0,austria,germany,1,44
6,"Oh you know, Austria, Germany, it's generally considered suicide to go after each other.",True,1,0,germany,austria,2,50
6,And yes I’m always happier as Austria when Germany lets people know that we are allies,True,1,0,austria,germany,3,52
6,You said once again though.,True,1,0,austria,germany,4,53
6,"Oh well, you were Italy in game 9 yes?",True,1,0,germany,austria,5,54
6,How’d you figure that out?,True,1,0,austria,germany,6,58
6,"Well, you're the only one that was in both games and both discord channels, process of elimination.",True,1,0,germany,austria,7,59
6,Gotcha hahaha,True,1,0,austria,germany,8,75
6,Hopefully it isn’t an issue with the study that we figured it out,True,1,0,austria,germany,9,76
6,"Well, they did say that anonymity was optional",True,1,0,germany,austria,10,79
6,Sounds good,True,1,0,austria,germany,11,102
6,So what’re you seeing from the board so far?,True,1,0,austria,germany,12,103
6,"Russia hasn't spoken much, but enough for me to know that they aren't my enemy. Italy is maintaining friendly terms with me, and the French seem pretty insistent that we can be allies as well. I think that if all is as it seems, the corner powers, Turks and English, are the most in trouble at the moment.",True,1,0,germany,austria,13,107
6,This is of course barring treachery,True,1,0,germany,austria,14,108
6,I’d assume you will be trying to recruit France to go for england then?,True,1,0,austria,germany,15,115
6,"That's the hope, yes",True,1,0,germany,austria,16,118
6,This group doesn’t seem very chatty,True,1,0,austria,germany,17,119
6,"Certainly doesn't, might be easier to go outside and squeeze trees for sap.",True,1,0,germany,austria,18,120
6,The Italians are eying you up as a potential enemy.,True,1,0,germany,austria,19,144
6,Everything proceeds according to plan thusfar,True,1,0,germany,austria,20,154
6,Can you do me a favor and bounce russia in Swe since they tried to hit Gal. And I’ll try to talk to Italy because I don’t really wanna fight them,True,1,0,austria,germany,21,156
6,"I'll try talking to the Russians first, but if I think they're lying to me or if they refuse, I'll bounce them.",True,1,0,germany,austria,22,159
6,"Actually, nevermind. I'm not going to speak with them, I'll just bounce them; you can count on at least one army coming your direction to help with them after this season.",True,1,0,germany,austria,23,161
6,"Looks like they're going to try a Juggernaut, I may have to alter my western triple plans accordingly.",True,1,0,germany,austria,24,163
6,"Ouch, I was going to ask Turkey to support me into Rum for a take or a bounce, either way it would hold russia from building",True,1,0,austria,germany,25,164
6,"Thanks for the heads up, we will see what turkey says",True,1,0,austria,germany,26,165
6,"Yeah, the Russians and Turks seem to have arranged that bounce for the Black Sea while the Russians maneuvered south. They want us to think that they're not friends until the moment they start supporting each other around. I'll talk to the Russians and Turks to see if I can squeeze some info out of them eh?",True,1,0,germany,austria,27,169
6,Sounds good! I’m trying to smooth things out with Italy right now,True,1,0,austria,germany,28,171
6,I’ll talk to england and let you know if I hear anything,True,1,0,austria,germany,29,172
6,"The English and I are, for the time being, on good terms, but any wild cards you could find out for me would be appreciated.",True,1,0,germany,austria,30,174
6,Reached out to France as well so I will let you know. Looks like they might fight so that will be a fun situation for you,True,1,0,austria,germany,31,176
6,"Yeah, the Triple's going ideally for me, thank goodness.",True,1,0,germany,austria,32,178
6,Did you actually hear from someone that a Juggernaut is happening or did you just get that from reading the board,True,1,0,austria,germany,33,201
6,Just a hunch from reading the board.,True,1,0,germany,austria,34,212
6,Because if I move into Rum thinking turkey will support and they don’t and move into Gre instead then I am in bad shape.,True,1,0,austria,germany,35,214
6,But if the move works then Russia doesn’t get a build,True,1,0,austria,germany,36,215
6,"Can you try and approach turkey and get some info, not sure if they’d believe you’re attempting an attack on me but it could work.",True,1,0,austria,germany,37,216
6,I've done so but they have yet to respond.,True,1,0,germany,austria,38,217
6,"Tight lipped, this whole group",True,1,0,germany,austria,39,218
6,How frustrating,True,1,0,austria,germany,40,219
6,Incredibly,True,1,0,germany,austria,41,224
6,Yeah hearing from Turkey that Italy doesn’t love me either so I have to watch out for that,True,1,0,austria,germany,42,228
6,He told me not to trust you but I don’t know how you would really attack me so,True,1,0,austria,germany,43,229
6,"Turkey's trying to push you away from those who might come to your aid earnestly, if he hasn't mentioned Russia then that's more evidence that the two of them are cooperating.",True,1,0,germany,austria,44,230
6,"Makes sense, I’ll probably have to play conservatively",True,1,0,austria,germany,45,231
6,"God I'm a fucking idiot, ugh. I accidentally sent a message intended for the English to the French, and the way it's worded makes me look sus as fuck.",True,1,0,germany,austria,46,247
6,"Worst case scenario here is that this is literally the turning point where all my planning goes down the drain and the two, who were about to fuckin' duke it out, turn into an Entente. Fuck. FUCK.",True,1,0,germany,austria,47,248
6,"That’s not good I’m sorry man, england and I just started talking. Anything you would want me to say/get from him!",True,1,0,austria,germany,48,260
6,?,True,1,0,austria,germany,49,261
6,"Nothing much, I already got pretty much everything I need out of them.",True,1,0,germany,austria,50,262
6,Though if you could unsuspiciously ask them if they have some kind of plan regarding France or I that'd be very useful.,True,1,0,germany,austria,51,263
6,"Ok, so I think the French might just think I'm an idiot now, which is a far better outcome than I could have possibly hoped for all things considered. If anything that's better than the status quo before, because they won't think I'm smart enough to betray them competently.",True,1,0,germany,austria,52,267
6,"Russia just confirmed, it's a Juggernaut",True,1,0,germany,austria,53,284
6,That’s unfortunate,True,1,0,austria,germany,54,288

6,"I'll be mobilizing forces East, hopefully the Russians will be too busy with me to keep the Turks alive.",True,1,0,germany,austria,56,290
6,Hopefully Italy stays with me.,True,1,0,austria,germany,57,292
6,They'd have to be fools not to.,True,1,0,germany,austria,58,294
6,Yeah I’ve talked with him a little and he agrees that a strong turkey will eventually be bad for him,True,1,0,austria,germany,59,295
6,"Good, hopefully he'll maintain that opinion.",True,1,0,germany,austria,60,298
6,How'd you swindle the Russians into staying put this time?,True,1,1,germany,austria,61,310
6,"I didn’t know they’d do that, never asked them to",True,1,-1,austria,germany,62,323
6,"Glad I guessed right on Turkey. He’s still acting like we could be allies, and is apologizing for not notifying me of his change of plans. He told me that he didn’t support me into Rum because Russia agreed to bounce in BLA again so I wouldn’t need the support to bounce. So he’s claiming to be angry at Russia",True,1,-1,austria,germany,63,343
6,"That's a good joke. That basically confirms it though, even if it weren't already. They're working together.",True,1,1,germany,austria,64,344
6,Yes,True,1,-1,austria,germany,65,354
6,Lol especially with that fleet build,True,1,-1,austria,germany,66,355
6,What’s the situation out West?,True,1,-1,austria,germany,67,389
6,"Sorry for not responding, busy weekend, but apparently the British have caught onto my tricks, the French and I are allied though. The Italians should be able to prove distracting enough that France won't be able to roll over me once Britain's gone though.",True,1,1,germany,austria,68,421
6,"What's the Plan with you? We can effectively guarantee that Warsaw falls, but I can't hold Sweden, and Vienna is terribly exposed.",True,1,1,germany,austria,69,422
6,"Also, either the Russians and Turks are doing a more convincing act than I did last game, or the Juggernaut has fallen apart.",True,1,1,germany,austria,70,427
6,Yeah I didn’t believe that turkey wanted to go against Russia but it looks like he actually does,True,1,-1,austria,germany,71,429
6,"Not sure about my plan I have to look at the board, I will get back to you",True,1,-1,austria,germany,72,430
6,I think I will be able to hold all of my supply centers.,True,1,-1,austria,germany,73,433
6,Are you gonna support me into Gal in order to guarantee that War falls?,True,1,-1,austria,germany,74,434
6,Wouldn't displacing Gal just give the Russians Vienna for free basically?,True,1,1,germany,austria,75,437
6,I meant support Gal into War my bad,True,1,-1,austria,germany,76,438
6,"Geez, Ukr into Gal",True,1,-1,austria,germany,77,439
6,Oh my gosh,True,1,-1,austria,germany,78,440
6,"Ukr into War, final answer",True,1,-1,austria,germany,79,441
6,"I was really hoping to secure Warsaw for myself, truth be told, unless you intend to stay friends with the Turks once Russia's finished off, but then again I'm not under any specific threat so I suppose you can have it.",True,1,1,germany,austria,80,442
6,Do you want both of mine supporting or is one free to maneuver?,True,1,1,germany,austria,81,443
6,My only reasoning behind you supporting me in is that it guarantees we take it even if he supports it holding with Gal. They only way for this to 100% work is both of yours supporting me in,True,1,-1,austria,germany,82,444
6,"Because I can’t hit Gal this turn, I have to cover my own ass",True,1,-1,austria,germany,83,445
6,"Silesia being the one to move would also render a 100% success rate, that fleet in Sev can't cut Ukraine and Prissoa isn't under threat",True,1,1,germany,austria,84,446
6,Prussia*,True,1,1,germany,austria,85,447
6,"You’re right, rough morning for me apparently. I’ll support you in you’re doing more of the work",True,1,-1,austria,germany,86,448
6,"Alright, from there Moscow is yours, I'll take St. Petersburg and Sweden and you'll take Romania and Sevastopol, as well as, of course, whatever you can get off the Turks.",True,1,1,germany,austria,87,449
6,Hopefully it all actually works out that way! It’s gonna be messy over here if me turkey and Russia all can’t trust each other,True,1,-1,austria,germany,88,450
6,"It's already messy all over, hopefully it ends in our favor",True,1,1,germany,austria,89,451
6,Once again I feel like allying with you is the best move because you talk more than anyone else hahaha,True,1,-1,austria,germany,90,452
6,"Yeah, literally nobody aside from you has responded for like 24 hours",True,1,1,germany,austria,91,453
6,"It makes it very hard to build alliances, I realize people have jobs and stuff but still it’s hard",True,1,-1,austria,germany,92,454
6,"Yeah, not sure what it is.",True,1,1,germany,austria,93,455
6,Lmk when you have time to talk,True,1,-1,austria,germany,94,519
6,"I've got time right now, btw, the Turks just came to me asking if I was interested in attacking you.",True,1,1,germany,austria,95,522
6,"Okay he’s a confusing player, I think I need to trust him short term but keep an eye on him",True,1,-1,austria,germany,96,524
6,"Well he also just said that if the two of you can get on the same page Russia's done for, so I think he wants to give it another shot.",True,1,1,germany,austria,97,526
6,"Yeah he does, may have been reaching out to you because he is iffy on me",True,1,-1,austria,germany,98,528
6,He’s worried about you and France,True,1,-1,austria,germany,99,529
6,"I mean shit, I'm worried about me and France too. Our position as friends is tenuous at best if you ask me.",True,1,1,germany,austria,100,531
6,😂,True,1,-1,austria,germany,101,537
6,And they barely fuckin' talk,True,1,1,germany,austria,102,539
6,I need to know if I'm moving into the North Sea or not damnit!,True,1,1,germany,austria,103,540
6,What is your stance on me taking War,True,1,-1,austria,germany,104,543
6,"Like how opposed are you, because I understand that you could risk it and try and just take it your self",True,1,-1,austria,germany,105,545
6,"I'm not terribly opposed, but me taking it would have us in better position to take Moscow if you ask me, assuming that Ukraine isn't displaced.",True,1,1,germany,austria,106,547
6,"That’s true, to be honest my reasoning is that Turkey is freaking out about you and if I support you in I might lose him for good. For that reason he wants me to cut support in Sev so that he can take Rum or attack Mos to either take that or bounce it. I don’t wanna do either of those things so I thought if you support me in then you are happy because russia loses a center, Turkey is happy because you don’t gain one, and I am happy because I gain one",True,1,-1,austria,germany,107,550
6,However your reason for being happy isn’t as convincing as ours,True,1,-1,austria,germany,108,551
6,"Well the real problem in any case is that if you get too buddy buddy with the Turks, the Italians lose a lot of incentive to be your ally and gain a lot of incentive to hit you while your back's turned.",True,1,1,germany,austria,109,552
6,And the Turks honestly don't have more than a tenuous and temporary reason to be your friend either.,True,1,1,germany,austria,110,553
6,"Totally understand that, I don’t want to be allied with the Turks but warring them and Russia at the same time is a pain in the ass. I’m convinced that they are against Russia and will help me until they know russia will go down (which could very well only be this fall or fall and spring)",True,1,-1,austria,germany,111,555
6,"Yeah, once the Russians lose Warsaw they're on the ropes and have very little chance of stopping us, and the Balkans are pretty well tied up in any case as long as the Italians remain dedicated.",True,1,1,germany,austria,112,556
6,"I am still talking to Italy and would have no issues with them attacking turkey, I just don’t want turkey attacking me. As for an Italian stab, they are now in a position where attacking me is a multi turn process that I would see coming",True,1,-1,austria,germany,113,557
6,"True, unless they build in Venice.",True,1,1,germany,austria,114,563
6,"Fair, still not that worried about Italy though. I would definitely trust them more than turkey",True,1,-1,austria,germany,115,568
6,"Same, and with France breathing down their necks they're unlikely to consider treachery.",True,1,1,germany,austria,116,570
6,So what are your final thoughts on my proposal,True,1,-1,austria,germany,117,572
6,If you don’t like it you don’t need to lie to me but I feel like it’s a solid compromise,True,1,-1,austria,germany,118,573
6,"I would certainly prefer having Warsaw myself, and eventually I would prefer to get it from you, but if you think that it'd be better for you to have it I will support that.",True,1,1,germany,austria,119,574
6,I am not against an eventual transfer as long as it would not result in a disband,True,1,-1,austria,germany,120,575
6,"Of course, it would be in a season where you'd made gains.",True,1,1,germany,austria,121,576
6,So yes you will support?,True,1,-1,austria,germany,122,577
6,I will.,True,1,1,germany,austria,123,578
6,"Thank you, owe you one",True,1,-1,austria,germany,124,579
6,"Alright, the Turkish/Russian Alliance is pretty thoroughly ruined at this point, think it's safe to double down with the Italians to crush them now.",True,1,1,germany,austria,125,642
6,"Fair, thank you for actually sending me into War. We might even be able to do a transfer this spring",True,1,-1,austria,germany,126,644
6,Though if you told  the Italians that you were moving on Bulgaria they might be understandably miffed to have missed that opportunity.,True,1,1,germany,austria,127,645
6,"That would be really nice, I could really use the units.",True,1,1,germany,austria,128,646
6,No I didn’t tell them that,True,1,-1,austria,germany,129,647
6,Ill be able to use my new one to push back russia,True,1,-1,austria,germany,130,648
6,"Well pushing back Russia isn't really the concern anymore, they're going to have to disband, the real concern now needs to be curbing the Turks before they gain enough momentum on you two.",True,1,1,germany,austria,131,649
6,The Russians are all kinds of out of position to boot.,True,1,1,germany,austria,132,650
6,Yeah plus they have zero allies,True,1,-1,austria,germany,133,651
6,"Unless you count the British, but they made no attempt to help out this time.",True,1,1,germany,austria,134,652
6,"So France is going full split fronts, how’re you feeling about getting through england",True,1,0,austria,germany,135,698
6,"It'll be slow, but as soon as Russia's dispatched properly the British won't be able to stop me hammering through them.",True,1,0,germany,austria,136,699
6,I’m trying to figure out if I wanna convince Italy to lay off of turkey,True,1,0,austria,germany,137,700
6,"Alright, so Warsaw can support do what it likes, but helping me into Livonia would be pretty ideal.",True,1,0,germany,austria,138,711
6,Yeah I’ll do that but you need to support War holding then with Sil,True,1,0,austria,germany,139,716
6,That's the plan,True,1,0,germany,austria,140,719
6,What do you think russia will do with Gal this turn lol. Such a wild card,True,1,0,austria,germany,141,724
6,I could see him moving/retreating into Boh just to make my life difficult,True,1,0,austria,germany,142,725

6,Hopefully,True,1,0,austria,germany,144,728
6,"I’m gonna reach out to england about seeing if they would take St P, even though it would be selfish and short sighted of him it might be enticing enough for him to do it",True,1,0,austria,germany,145,729

6,"It would be good Intel for France and I as well, to see if we can afford to get aggressive with our fleets.",True,1,0,germany,austria,148,732
6,I’ll let you know if he even responds,True,1,0,austria,germany,149,736
6,Are you hitting BOT this turn? I think you should,True,1,0,austria,germany,150,760

6,Okay cool,True,1,0,austria,germany,152,762
6,Any chance you could approach turkey about attacking me once russia is done? I don’t trust that I’m not his next expansion target.,True,1,0,austria,germany,153,763
6,I would do the same for you if you would like,True,1,0,austria,germany,154,764

6,How recently,True,1,0,austria,germany,156,769
6,"Monday. I can check again if you'd like, but in any case siding with the Turks is a sucker's bet for you. Once Russia's gone they have nowhere to expand and they're at your back, and siding with them will rapidly erode Italy's willingness to side with you.",True,1,0,germany,austria,157,773
6,Interested to see if Russia has actually quit,True,1,0,austria,germany,158,795
6,Same. Turks have yet to respond to me seeing how interested they are in betraying you,True,1,0,germany,austria,159,796
6,Haven’t talked to me yet either,True,1,0,austria,germany,160,801
6,Do you think taking Gre was a bad move,True,1,0,austria,germany,161,802
6,"Well, you can count on Italy not being fans of the move.",True,1,0,germany,austria,162,806
6,"Turkey's starting to respond, their biggest question so far is how we would split you, east/west or north/south.",True,1,0,germany,austria,163,807
6,"I personally wouldn't have done it, you need the Italians to keep the French off your border and to help if the Turks decide to take you down, andthe Turks have no reason not to want you dead if the opportunity arises. You don't need them for Russia anymore, so who do you need them for? What do they need you for? Furthermore, where can they go now to expand?",True,1,0,germany,austria,164,808
6,"Yeah I’m just going to have to anticipate the stab. Honestly I was tired of working with Italy. He was constantly reading the board poorly, saw France coming and mishandled it, and other stuff.",True,1,0,austria,germany,165,812

6,Have you talked with France about their Tyr move,True,1,-1,austria,germany,173,893
6,"Yeah, it's an Italy-centric move. They mean you no harm as far as I'm aware.",True,1,1,germany,austria,174,894
6,They haven't been very talkative since Friday though so it's hard to say.,True,1,1,germany,austria,175,895
6,I’m assuming you’re responding to the France thing and not the turkey thing,True,1,-1,austria,germany,176,897
6,"Yeah, the Turkey thing can really only go one way.",True,1,1,germany,austria,177,899
6,"He says he’s convoying it to Apu, seems legit and if he moves it to Bul instead I will see it coming",True,1,-1,austria,germany,178,900
6,I need to figure out what direction I wanna go now,True,1,-1,austria,germany,179,901
6,"Not to sound like a broken clock or anything, but Turkey's got very little option but to fight you at this point, that's a pretty good direction to point yourself.",True,1,1,germany,austria,180,902
6,Neither of us are in a position for it right now though,True,1,-1,austria,germany,181,908
6,"So what are you gonna do, you committed a lot of stuff East that isn’t very useful anymore",True,1,-1,austria,germany,182,911

6,"Personally? Not really, but it's possible.",True,1,1,germany,austria,185,914
6,My only holdup with it is that he could have just built the army in Smy then,True,1,-1,austria,germany,186,915
6,Exactly,True,1,1,germany,austria,187,918
6,"Gonna see if France is willing to talk, will let you know what he says about you",True,1,-1,austria,germany,188,919

6,"Me either, I’m honestly not sure I can win",True,1,-1,austria,germany,196,969
6,It might be possible if you reconcile with the Italians and help them push off the French.,True,1,1,germany,austria,197,970
6,It would at the very least become a lot more likely. Turkish naval supremacy makes things immensely difficult for you.,True,1,1,germany,austria,198,972
6,"I'm all in on your side here but my navy's on the other side of the map and armies can only touch Turkey and shore you up if I enter your personal space, so to speak.",True,1,1,germany,austria,199,973

6,The heck are the Turks up to even?,True,1,3,germany,austria,209,1113
6,"Ugh, I feel like a jerk putting the knife in France's back this hard. Feels way worse than what I did to the Turks last time.",True,1,3,germany,austria,210,1133
6,Turkey thought we had an alliance but the last time we talked he said he was attacking Me until we figured it out. We never talked because I was a little in active I didn’t reach out until last night so I had to put in orders against him. He trusted me blindly,True,1,-3,austria,germany,211,1141
6,"France is bummed, just sent us a mass message to attack you",True,1,-3,austria,germany,212,1142

6,"Soon as you take out the Turks and the Italians we can end it, and the Turks are definitely on the ropes.",True,1,4,germany,austria,226,1178
6,"If you had more troops this direction I'd suggest we could work together to displace Tyrolia with one of your armies, but you'd have to cover Trieste and Turkey could easily take advantage of that in the current state.",True,1,4,germany,austria,227,1180
6,Are you saying two way?,True,1,-4,austria,germany,228,1182
6,Unless you can think of anyone else who we'd include.,True,1,4,germany,austria,229,1184

6,Why would I do that?,True,0,4,germany,austria,231,1191
6,Lol because you probably can,True,1,-4,austria,germany,232,1192
6,"I mean, I probably could have last time too, if I hadn't spent half the game with 6 armies sitting around doing nothing lol",True,1,4,germany,austria,233,1195

6,"Can't imagine why the French would, but apparantly they want to pick fights with you too now.",True,1,4,germany,austria,244,1219
6,For me the problem country is Italy. Can never get the hang of it.,True,1,4,germany,austria,245,1220
6,"Tbf I can't even really talk, the British are being extremely uncooperative because of my previous action against them.",True,1,4,germany,austria,246,1221
6,"I actually like Italy, as you know I try as hard as I can to ally with Russia. If I can’t get that then usually Turkey will attack Austria with me.",True,1,-4,austria,germany,247,1222
6,"Yeah, Italy's really one where you have to go with the Russians or get REALLY unorthodox, the generally accepted path is kinda crap.",True,1,4,germany,austria,248,1223
6,Most Italians just start a fight with Austria without reaching out to other people that’s the issue,True,1,-4,austria,germany,249,1224
6,I suppose it's another one that requires really good coordination. I can never convince the French it isn't worth it though.,True,1,4,germany,austria,250,1227
6,As Italy?,True,1,-4,austria,germany,251,1228
6,These games through the study are the only ones I have ever really played where France goes for Italy. I don’t know if it’s because players are more experienced here or just a coincidence,True,1,-4,austria,germany,252,1229
6,"Not sure, I've seen it fairly frequently.",True,1,4,germany,austria,253,1230

6,True,True,1,-4,austria,germany,258,1238
6,"Would you like me to come down and help expel the French? I can mobilize Munich and Warsaw to the task. It would involve moving into Bohemia and Tyrolia, but drastic times call for drastic measures.",True,1,4,germany,austria,259,1253
6,Yeah I’d appreciate it,True,1,-4,austria,germany,260,1258
6,Not a good turn for me I made some bad guesses,True,1,-4,austria,germany,261,1259
6,"No worries, I'll come down to help out.",True,1,4,germany,austria,262,1260
6,So I just realized that my mind made a goof and Warsaw doesn't border Bohemia. Would you mind terribly if I moved into Galicia to help ensure you can expel the French? From there we can mutually bounce in Budapest while displacing Venice (Assuming that you don't successfully occupy Budapest in Spring). You'll need to hold Budapest on your own power for the first turn though.,True,1,4,germany,austria,263,1262
6,"Also, if you retreat to the Adriatic you can take Venice uncontested.",True,1,4,germany,austria,264,1263
6,Yeah do what you need but obviously we will continue to coordinate,True,1,-5,austria,germany,265,1265

6,"Oh hey, everything went great; situation normal",True,1,5,germany,austria,268,1286
6,Do you think it'd be a good idea for me to temporarily occupy Vienna to deprive the French of the dot? Or would you be uncomfortable with that you think,True,1,5,germany,austria,269,1287
6,"I mean it’s not mine right now, go for it",True,1,-5,austria,germany,270,1296
6,If I could get in it would be a different story,True,1,-5,austria,germany,271,1297

6,"Yeah you have to because of that French unit, he’s annoyingly",True,1,-7,austria,germany,275,1335
6,Incredibly. He's sacrificing his ability to hang on to territory in favor of being a thorn in our mutual side.,True,1,7,germany,austria,276,1336
6,Turkey is getting on my nerves. Keeps just yelling at me lol,True,1,-7,austria,germany,277,1349

6,"I sure would love to, but at this point I'm not sure it's possible, these games are limited to year 10 and that's rapidly approaching. I don't think we can make up the lost ground for you even if they all post four no-orders turns.",True,1,7,germany,austria,279,1358
6,"There's basically only two ways for this to finish, four way draw and German victory. I hate to say it and I won't suggest one over the other to you, but I think it should be clear which I'd greatly prefer.",True,1,7,germany,austria,280,1359
6,Ya plus I just messed up,True,1,-7,austria,germany,281,1360
6,"Yeah, even if this kept going after year ten that would be a terrible setback",True,1,7,germany,austria,282,1361
6,Honesty not quite the best policy on this one eh? In any case I understand.,True,1,14,germany,austria,283,1378

You and I have much to talk about, and if we don't get certain things sorted out and understood between us I'm afraid that any conflict that might arise would surely sink us both.
